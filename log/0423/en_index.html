  <p class="style5">Dido Tell me, Am I Chopper?</p>
  <p>My sweet dream came right after I slaughtered that mosquito.</p>
  <p>I set my alarm to wake me up at 7 o’clock but my body pulled my up at six.</p>
  <p>I went to clean myself, brush my teeth and of course make my necessities. </p>
  <p>In China most toilets are not toilets or so we call it traditional toilet.</p>
  <p> We have to bend down instead of sitting.</p>
  <p> Now this bathroom doesn’t have doors so if someone came in we can salute each other and the shit together.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I didn’t take out much stuff from my packs yesterday so I didn’t have to organize much this morning. </p>
  <p>However I am carrying 5 packs of stuffs and since the trip just started,</p>
  <p> every time I need something I have to go through each pack before I find it.</p>
  <p> Well, if you are wondering, I did packed myself, but I am not familiar with where I put my stuffs.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I carried my bike and my luggage up three floors to the lobby.</p>
  <p> Mario was sleeping in the counter since he covered the night shift.</p>
  <p> I believe that Zhao sir drank too much yesterday and fell asleep on the lobby’s sofa. </p>
  <p>I didn’t want to wake them up so I opened the door silently and put all the packs back to the bike. </p>
  <p>The packs all together are very heavy. My LGS-GMT has to carry all that and me.</p>
  <p> I feel compassion for it so every night when I find a place to stay I will take off all the packs and let my bike relax a little.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It doesn’t sound charming that each time I refer to my bike as LGS-GMT. </p>
  <p>Since this bike will travel with my for half a year if I don’t give it a name I won’t feel good. </p>
  <p>Therefore from now on my partner will be called Dido. </p>
  <p>Please everyone reading remember from now on that my partner for the next six months, my bike, is Dido.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mario and Zhao sir woke up right after I finished hanging all the packs on Dido.</p>
  <p> I took out two water bottles and asked Mario to fill them up for my trip.</p>
  <p>Mario only had hot water so he fills the bottles with hot water.</p>
  <p> As we all know plastic bottles don’t react nicely to hot water.</p>
  <p> My bottles went soft on me. Zhao sir asked me if I drink Tea.</p>
  <p> He gave me some tea for one bottle and another one with water.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000345.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Zhao sir took care of me because I am four months younger than his son. He thought of me like a son.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I bought a instant noodle (2.5RMB), two small hot dogs (1RMB each) and a coke (3RMB) with 5 bucks of deposit for the hotel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000349.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I used up the deposit and at the same time I got some changes with Mario.</p>
  <p> Chinese RMB is very interesting, I received 97.5RMB in which the 100 RMB is paper bill, the 50, the 10 and 1 RMB are all paper bill,</p>
  <p> even the 5 cents is also paper bill. Not a single coin. Mario gave me all 5 RMB bills so I can use it on my way without problem.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Yesterday night when I checked in I only know that this is a cheap place to stay, but I don’t even know where I am. </p>
  <p>Therefore I took out my map and let Zhao sir to mark a circle to where I am at. </p>
  <p>I departed from this circle at seven thirty and planned to get to Tian Tan (Temple of Heaven) at eight. </p>
  <p>But Beijing is so big and its roads are so complicated. People gazed at me riding my bike with all my gears. </p>
  <p>In Beijing there are automobile lanes and bicycle lanes. There are no motorcycle lanes. </p>
  <p>I couldn’t see one single motorcycle on the street even its busy Monday morning.</p>
  <p> It is so different than Taipei’s streets. I made an effort to figure out my exact position. </p>
  <p>After taking a few wrong ways finally I got to Tian Tan without more incidents.</p>
  <p> However I arrived 40 minutes later than announced. </p>
  <p>I am so embarrassed to make the reporters wait on my first day departure.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A lot of elder peoples cheered me after the interview, </p>
  <p>and then I officially initiated my bike journey from Tian Tan at around nine thirty. </p>
  <p>After riding for a while, I remembered that I didn’t take any picture there for souvenir. </p>
  <p>Well let it be, what is past has passed. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today’s goal is Baoding. People told me that it’s easy to get there.</p>
  <p> I just have to ride on a side way along the Jingshi Expressway.</p>
  <p> From the map it also appeared very simple to get there. </p>
  <p>However in reality is a totally different story. </p>
  <p>While I was still in Beijing city I asked ten or more people how to get to Baoding. </p>
  <p>Every time I encountered a diversion with 2 roads to chose I asked people and made sure that I am on the right way. </p>
  <p>I even saw a traffic sign telling me that there’s 138Km left to Baoding.</p>
  <p> Looked so simple, but I still got lost. I am definitely not a good navigator.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000370.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I ate the bread I got from airplane yesterday and swallowed it for breakfast. </p>
  <p>I was still hungry. Around ten thirty I saw someone selling chow fan (stir rice). </p>
  <p>It looked delicious, so I stopped and ordered for a service.</p>
  <p> This chow fan was not cooked using propane gas it used coal.</p>
  <p> You can say it’s barbequed. The owner is a woman with last name Zhao. </p>
  <p>So I call her madam Zhao. She commanded her daughter to make a chow fan for me. </p>
  <p>One serving of chow fan is only 3RMB! So cheap, this is the journey I was longing for!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A serving of chow fan was double of those I eat in Taiwan and it came with some spicy radish and soy bean.</p>
  <p> It tasted super salty I had to take it down with water. I chatted with madam Zhao as I ate. </p>
  <p>They are from Jiangsu. Since she had 3 daughters the third one who cooked for me is called Zhao the third. </p>
  <p>After hearing this the seventeen years old lady Zhao was stomping her foot and said “Mom! Come on that’s not true.”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000377.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I was so full after taking down the chow fan with a keg of water. </p>
  <p>This is was a good deal, it served as a brunch. I asked madam Zhao for water and she gladly consented.</p>
  <p> In the morning when I get prepared and went to Tian Tan the sky was cloudy and now just after I eat the sun came out.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000382.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Stomach full and thirst quenched it’s time to get going.</p>
  <p> Beijing is so huge by now I am still in Beijing.</p>
  <p> I asked very seriously to police, the mister who was smoking, the guy tending the fruit stand, the woman selling pigeon egg, </p>
  <p>everybody was so sure and told me that I was on the right way to Baoding. Then I just got lost.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Baoding is located right south of Beijing in theory I just have to go south. </p>
  <p>But somehow I was going west and at some point I went north.</p>
  <p> And Jingshi Expressway supposed to be a big, straight and long expressway but why I am always on small country road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000384.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>This country road was in very bad condition, but that not all. </p>
  <p>Trucks loaded with coal passing constantly beside me.</p>
  <p> What is going on? When the trucks approximated me within 50 meters they played the horn for three times. </p>
  <p>I believe they think that I am deaf or maybe they wanted me deaf. </p>
  <p>Every time a truck goes by me, it raised a cloud of coal dust. </p>
  <p>Now I was certain that I was so lost.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000390.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Even knowing for fact that I got lost, I kept going. </p>
  <p>This mainly is because I don’t like to turn back. </p>
  <p>I strongly believed that if I kept going I will be back at the right way. </p>
  <p>So I rode for around 80Km in this coal dusted road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000403.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I couldn’t find any sign that I saw on the map I had. </p>
  <p>Every time I asked someone if I was on the right track to Baoding, </p>
  <p>the answer was head shakes and that I was going on the wrong and the long way.</p>
  <p> They told me to head back to Beijing.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000409.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I just wouldn’t want to turn back.</p>
  <p> I rode from eleven in the morning to three in the afternoon.</p>
  <p> I finally decided that I was going on the wrong way when I saw a little dog sniffing the garbage beside a gentleman.</p>
  <p> He told me that I was wrong.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000415.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Hunger attacked me around three in the afternoon. </p>
  <p>I took out the two hotdogs I bought from Mario’s together with a pack of cookies I bought in Taiwan. </p>
  <p>Bikes don’t need fuel but the rider must feed himself in order to maintain the calories needed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000417.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I was supposed to go south but I kept riding west. </p>
  <p>Here I was in deep west region called Fangshan where coal was produced. </p>
  <p>That’s why so many coal trucks passed by me playing their horn and raising coal dust.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000402.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Coal dust was everywhere. With a broom you can literally collect a cart full of coal dust. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since I was on the wrong way it is certain that I won’t get to Baoding today.</p>
  <p> So I decided to ride till 5 o’clock and then look for a place to spend the night. </p>
  <p>Around five thirty, I saw a flock of students. </p>
  <p>Each of the Chinese kids have a reddish cheek. I really wanted to squeeze them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000420.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I took a picture of the kids in exchange of some information.</p>
  <p>“Is there a place to stay on this road?”<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The kids were studying at Xiapu Elementary. </p>
  <p>Some of them answered me that 5 more kilometers from here and others said that 10 more. </p>
  <p>So after discussing it they all agreed that it’s 7 more kilometers from where we were. </p>
  <p>They were extremely interested in Dido so in appreciation of their information I answered their questions. </p>
  <p>“What you carry in the bags?” “What is this and that?”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I waved my big hand and bade farewell. </p>
  <p>I hoped to find a place to stay after 7 more kilometers. </p>
  <p>The kids were quite accurate, at six thirty, when the day was still bright; I found a place “Fortune Hotel”. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000425.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I asked: “How much is one night?”</p>
  <p>“10RMB!” was the answer</p>
  <p>Holy cow~ This is so cheap. I couldn’t believe that with 10RMB I can find a place to stay.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Yes but that wasn’t the hotel that was only the part of restaurant and groceries.</p>
  <p> I had to walk a down hill to the house with flowers on the tree in the picture. That’s their home and hotel. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000433.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>There’s one larger room with six beds for guests. The smaller room of about 6 m² was for the family.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000426.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>The grandmother of about 70 years old carried her heavy food steps and opened the door for me.</p>
  <p> I put Dido in the room and discovered SHE’s (a famous pop group) poster on the wall.</p>
  <p> I couldn’t figure out how old the posters were.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000429.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I asked the grandma if I can take a shower. </p>
  <p>She told me that people around here only take bath once a week on Friday or Saturday. </p>
  <p>Nobody take bath daily.</p>
  <p> I bet Misasa wants to move over here so she doesn’t have to take bath every day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Grandma gave me a bucket of water.</p>
  <p> I used it to wash my dirty hands, filthy face full of coal dust and I wiped my body. That counts as a bath.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000430.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I took off Dido’s heavy load and went to the restaurant.</p>
  <p> I asked the owner what they had in the menu. </p>
  <p>She told me they had lamb, pork or vegetarian dumplings.</p>
  <p> I ordered a quarter kilogram of pork dumplings. </p>
  <p>It’s amazing that dumplings are not counted per quantity but per weight. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The family’s child ran before me while I waited for my dumplings. </p>
  <p>He asked me: </p>
  <p>“What are you doing?”</p>
  <p>“I am writing my diary recording what happened today” </p>
  <p>I answered finishing writing about a quarter kilogram of dumplings.</p>
  <p>“Where you come from?” The kid kept inquiring. </p>
  <p>“I came riding from Beijing from around right in the morning and I wanted to go to Baoding but I got lost so I ended up here.” </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The kid went ballistic laughing. </p>
  <p>It’s time I take some action, can’t always be questioned, I had to ask something.</p>
  <p>So I asked “What is your name?”</p>
  <p>The kid is Lesley Liu, he’s ten years old, the youngest of the family. </p>
  <p>He didn’t study in the Xiapu Elementary as the kids I met before. </p>
  <p>He studies in Centre Elementary in third grade.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>“Where is your school?” I asked</p>
  <p>“Xiaher.” He answered.</p>
  <p>That is a very strange place for me. I never planned to come here. </p>
  <p>Well but at least I know where I am and that’s enough.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My quarter kilogram of dumplings was served.</p>
  <p> I counted 27 dumplings so. Half kilogram of dumplings cost 10RMB so I only have to pay 5RMB.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000437.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I thought for myself that if I knew that I was going to have a plate full of dumplings I would have saved the cookies for later. </p>
  <p>Lesley really likes to perform so he first showed me the “fan dance” </p>
  <p>then he demonstrated martial arts and told me to “bring it on!”. Are you serious, kid.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Saved by grandma! She demanded Lesley to let me eat. </p>
  <p>So he went and fetched his treasure to show me.</p>
  <p> It is a toy car but so torn up it didn’t have the outer body.</p>
  <p> I felt pity for kids like him. They are so naive unlike Taiwanese kids </p>
  <p>who carry a bunch of game cards with them and act like a spoiled prince. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I showed him Dido. He curiously touches every part and then pointed at the water bottle and asked me:</p>
  <p> “What is that?”</p>
  <p>It is water bottle my dear, a water bottle.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000439.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>It was around seven thirty when I finished my dumplings and the day was already dark. </p>
  <p>I could see that Lesley was happy to see me finish my last dumpling since grandma’s command of let me eat expired. </p>
  <p>He followed me back to the house with intention to play with me. </p>
  <p>I remembered that I still had a 5cents bill so I gave it to him discreetly and asked him:</p>
  <p> “Don’t tell your mom I gave you this. You are a nice kid so keep this but let me get some rest Ok.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once I return to my room I started to organize today’s diary and pictures. </p>
  <p>At the same time I listened Lesley chat with grandma. I am the only guest in the room that only had one yellowish light bulb. </p>
  <p>Thankfully it had electric socket so I can recharge my camera and GPS for tomorrow’s journey.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I downloaded GPS’s data and used Google Earth to check how long I rode. </p>
  <p>It was surprising how much lost I was. I rode for 120Km today and every single kilometer were to the west. </p>
  <p>And carelessly I was riding towards the mountain. </p>
  <p>Grandma told me that if I kept going I will start climbing and it will be gravel road very difficult to ride on.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I didn’t feel so bad; Xian after all is on the south west. </p>
  <p>Even though I didn’t go south today I certain rode west for a good distance.</p>
  <p> I like unpredictable journey. If I arrived Baoding today according to plan then I would feel a little tired. </p>
  <p>Because that means I have to follow the plan and keep going to Shihjiazhuang or Stone Family Village. </p>
  <p>That is not bad either, it’s just to “by the book” and lacked adventure feeling. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Chopper is a character from the Japanese anime “One Piece”.</p>
  <p> He was a reindeer until he ate the “human fruit” which allowed him to speak, think, talk and changed into a human. </p>
  <p>Me, I didn’t eat any fruit but I am always helplessly lost. </p>
  <p>Thank you Dido for bearing the long lost ride today with me. </p>
  <p>We will get to Xian no matter what and that’s all that matters. </p>
  <p>It’s not a big deal getting lost and I like to randomly travel the road I like no matter what.<br />
