  <p class="style5">Lost In Paradise</p>
  <p>Without the mosquitoes zooming around me I could have a nice sleep. </p>
  <p>But I woke up at around four thirty because the chickens outside of my room were clucking intensely. </p>
  <p>I slowly opened my eyes and looked outside. </p>
  <p>The day was getting bright but I still didn’t want to wake up, not this early. </p>
  <p>The problem was that I couldn’t turn off the clucking alarm. </p>
  <p>So I struggled and struggled till around five thirty and woke myself up. </p>
  <p>Before I slept Lesley’s mom gave me a thermo bottle, of course in it was hot water. </p>
  <p>I poured hot water in my bottle with Zhao sir’s tea and drank it to warm myself. </p>
  <p>It’s cold in the mountain and I was breathing white clouds out of my mouth.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I wore shorts and T-shirt and went out to pee. </p>
  <p>Next to the latrine there’s a big black pig and it was still sleeping. </p>
  <p>Even though I struggled for an hour to wake up but I am still more diligent than the pig. </p>
  <p>I felt good about this even though I am comparing myself with a pig. </p>
  <p>So I took a picture to prove that I am better than the pig.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000452.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In the house garden they have a tree full of beautiful flowers.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000458.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I did the bed and organized my luggage. </p>
  <p>I found my tear gas for self defense so I practiced with it.</p>
  <p>“Drop everything valuable right now!” The hijacker shouted.</p>
  <p>“I am so scared I can’t move, just come and take anything you want!” Me acting cowardly.</p>
  <p>And then when the robber comes close I take out the tear gas a spray his face.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I was acting out so realistic that I sprayed a little tear gas out. </p>
  <p>I thought that a little tear gas won’t do much affect so I kept organizing my luggage. </p>
  <p>On the next ten minutes I sneezed about thirty times. </p>
  <p>I checked Dido for loose nuts, aired the tires and then put the packs back on Dido. </p>
  <p>Then I pushed Dido right back up hill and went to have breakfast at the restaurant.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I told Fortune Restaurant’s owner, Hua Lee, that anything is fine for breakfast. </p>
  <p>So she gave me a big bowl of congee, a Chinese pancake and some salty pickled vegetables.</p>
  <p> The pancake was good, the congee was very common but the salty pickles were extremely salty, way over in salt.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000463.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> “Madam Hua, isn’t this too salty?”</p>
  <p>“Really? I pickled it two days ago and found it a little flavorless so I put more salt in.”</p>
  <p>With one spoon of congee I took a little piece of the salty pickle or I had to have a big bite on the pancake. </p>
  <p>I finished up the pancake and the congee but there is still plenty of salty pickles left. </p>
  <p>I could finish it. I know it’s good to eat something salty to regain my body’s lost salt but this is way over salted. </p>
  <p>I spend 1.5 on my breakfast.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>I took a picture of her before I left. </p>
  <p>Even I got here by my stupid mistake but it was nice to know such a nice restaurant and hotel.</p>
  <p> It was very fortunate for me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>I was on the wrong way but I insisted not to turn back. </p>
  <p>So I kept riding on the same direction. </p>
  <p>Madam Hua told me that if I kept going forward there’s an uphill of about 50~60Km. </p>
  <p>I don’t even know after climbing the hills I will get to my destination. </p>
  <p>Seven thirty I departed with determination.</p>
  <p>“Ride slowly and safely, come back and visit us any time.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The GPS told me that I was very lost yesterday so I will try to get out of the mountain today and head to the city. </p>
  <p>Before going downhill, I have a long hill to climb.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000471.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I rode for a long while since I departed around seven thirty.</p>
  <p> There’s no car going around me and it is very quiet </p>
  <p>however it was a long uphill ride combined with an unstoppable headwind. </p>
  <p>Rule number 12, as long as my speedometer shows that I am not going under 5Km/h</p>
  <p> there’s no need for me to walk and push my bike. Since walking speed is about 5Km/h.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Beautiful scenery decorated the road. It’s full of cherry blossoms on this mountain.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000479.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Twice I had chance to go off the mountain but I felt if I just left I would miss something. </p>
  <p>So I kept going a long way in the mountain. </p>
  <p>So when I finally got off the mountain I had to ride a longer way to my destination.</p>
  <p> In comparison with yesterday’s coal dusted road, </p>
  <p>todays is full of marble stone cut to rectangular shape and piled along the road or boxed.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000477.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was uphill all the way and the cliffs around me were very steep. </p>
  <p>It was so astonishing but at the same time I was afraid of loose rocks falling.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I felt exhausted around nine thirty since I was riding up hill since early in the morning. </p>
  <p>So I ate the butter I took at the airplane without anything </p>
  <p>but I was still hungry so I finished up my last provision, one pack of cookies.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Around ten past ten I arrived at a village called Tang Shang. </p>
  <p>There were about seven or eight women sitting by a door chatting </p>
  <p>so I asked them if there’s any restaurant along the way. </p>
  <p>They told me that if I climb a little more there’s a gas station ahead the sell food.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I then requested to take a picture of them but they said that they were ugly and hid themselves. </p>
  <p>I could only get one of them into the picture.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000489.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Along the way there were trees decorated with red flowers. </p>
  <p>When the wind blew the petals started to dance with the blowing wind. </p>
  <p>It’s a very stunning picture. It’s more like I rode into a paradise.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>Just like the women told me, after about 7 to 8Km I found a gas station but there were nobody.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000511.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I didn’t see any restaurant or restaurant signs there. </p>
  <p>I rode over with doubt. The owner opened the door and asked me to enter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The owner gave me a menu when I asked what they had. </p>
  <p>It’s so good to be able to read and understand the menu. </p>
  <p>They had varieties from cold dish to hot pot and from 5RMB to 18RMB. </p>
  <p>I thought for a moment then ordered a Kongbao chicken chump that cost 10RMB.<br />
  </p>
  <p>I drank tea while I waited. They even put flowers in the tea. </p>
  <p>Then the chef took out a big dish of chicken chump and a big bowl of white rice.</p>
  <p> I regret that I ate the cookies earlier, now I can’t finish this. Sigh…<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000507.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> People asked me where I was heading while I ate. </p>
  <p>I told them that I plan to go to Baoding and then head to Xian.</p>
  <p> I also told them that from Xiaher to here was all uphill, it was very though. </p>
  <p>The owner told me that it will be downhill after about 5Km. </p>
  <p>That’s a good news to me. Finally the long waited downhill will appear.</p>
  <p><br />
    I heard people saying that yesterday’s news said that someone will ride 15000Km in bicycle. </p>
  <p>I thought for myself, is that me? I wanted to keep low profile so I didn’t admit it. </p>
  <p>However the owner was very kin, </p>
  <p>when I finished about 90% of my food and was getting ready to start enjoy my downhill,</p>
  <p> the waiter told me: “You bill is on the boss. He won’t charge you.” </p>
  <p>Even though I was happy for having a free meal but I couldn’t just eat for free, </p>
  <p>but the owner insisted so I conceded.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000527.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I arrived at the peak of the mountain at eleven fifty, </p>
  <p>I didn’t take the road that appeared to be the way down </p>
  <p>and kept going on National Freeway G108 towards “Yeh San Po” which mean Three Wild Hills. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The uphill is very exhausting and the downhill are very dangerous. </p>
  <p>I couldn’t go fast because the road’s condition was bad. </p>
  <p>Paved road turned suddenly into gravel road if you go too fast </p>
  <p>and didn’t break on time then you might get a flat tire or even crash.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000532.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> I arrived at Yehsanpo around three in the afternoon.</p>
  <p> It is a popular place.</p>
  <p> I was attracted by it’s beauty so I stopped for several times to contemplate the mountain split by the river. </p>
  <p>I kept riding after I was satisfied. </p>
  <p>There’s a sign said that this place was registered as National Geological Park or Geopark by the UNESCO. </p>
  <p>I am so lucky to get lost and visit a place like this.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000554.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Many people comes here to draw the landscape or take wedding pictures.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000560.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I didn’t like the restaurants and the hotels in tourist area in the mid of the landscape. </p>
  <p>Since I don’t plan to stay here so I will just ride by fast.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I don’t know if my map was wrong or the traffic signs have some problem. </p>
  <p>I just can’t find the roads on my map when I saw a sign and I couldn’t find the places according to the map.</p>
  <p>Around twenty minutes to five I found a grocery store called “Lucky Century”. </p>
  <p>Seems like it’s a chain store and this is the number 808. </p>
  <p>That’s amazing 808 or more stores. </p>
  <p>I bought 2 packs of cookies (1.5RMB each) for provision and bought a orange sports drink (4RMB). </p>
  <p>I drank the juice at once and kept the bottle for water.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000561.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was 20 minutes to six in the afternoon. I couldn’t locate myself in my map. </p>
  <p>Finally I saw a sign that said Yi County and I also found it on my map. </p>
  <p>However it’s still 43Km away, if I want to ride there I will be arriving around eight. </p>
  <p>But at least it’s a right destination for me. </p>
  <p>So I pull myself together and rode vigorously towards Yi County.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Suddenly the road started to get foggy. </p>
  <p>By then I was only hoping to find any place to stay. I am not picky.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000572.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I asked someone in a small town about 20 minutes before dark: </p>
  <p>“Is there any place to stay for the night?”</p>
  <p>Right on my back a sign said “HOTEL”, I just couldn’t see it with the fading sunlight. <br />
  </p>
  <p>He pointed on my back told me “right here” and fetched the owner for me. </p>
  <p>The owner came to me laughing. I asked him for the price and it was 10RMB per night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000574.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The room didn’t look very clean however for the price I will be fine with it. </p>
  <p>I took off the heavy load from Dido and got ready to have dinner then I realized that the door knot was damaged. </p>
  <p>I went to get the owner and told him “I can’t lock the door, I won’t lose anything right?”</p>
  <p>The owner said: “Don’t worry, nothing will happen in my place.”</p>
  <p>I actually believe that my things are save under the owner’s magical guardian power. </p>
  <p>So I went to eat happily.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>I ordered a stir fry pancake (3 bucks), strips of pork ear (8 bucks) and a Snow Flake beer (3 bucks). </p>
  <p>Everything was served in a BIG dish.</p>
  <p>The stir fry pancake tasted like stir fry noodles. </p>
  <p>They cut the pancake into strips and stir fry with some vegetable and soy sauce and it’s very salty.</p>
  <p>The pork ear is a cold dish. This one is delicious, a little sour and salty. </p>
  <p>I ate it all accompanied with beer. <br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000585.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am sure that there must be full of fly and mosquito in this filthy room. </p>
  <p>I don’t think the blankets are clean either. </p>
  <p>First I went to the owner and asked for a bath. </p>
  <p>He gave me a bucket of water and then gave a bottle of hot water. </p>
  <p>I should mix the waters for bath. I took them back to my room and mixed them together to get my “hot tub”. </p>
  <p>I wiped clean my face and my whole body then I washed my head. </p>
  <p>It felt very nice since prior two days I only had cold water. </p>
  <p>I used what’s left to wash my babushka and my two days old socks.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000589.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I took out my sleeping bag and put it on bed and I planned to sleep </p>
  <p>in my sleeping bag because the room really looked filthy. </p>
  <p>I will have to repack the sleeping bag tomorrow which will be a hazard but at least I used it. </p>
  <p>Tomorrow I won’t be feeling that I am carrying a bunch of useless things.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before falling asleep I saw a bunch of mosquito and fly slamming against the dimming light bulb. </p>
  <p>I believed that the bugs won’t let me have a quiet good quality sleep. </p>
  <p>I tuck myself into the sleeping bag and covered my head with my jacket and went to sleep. </p>
  <p>My jacket fell off when I was sleeping but the bugs didn’t bug me at all. </p>
  <p>So I got to sleep nicely after all.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My plan was to get to Baoding in two days but seems like it will take three. </p>
  <p>I actually don’t really want to ride between big cities because things are more expensive, </p>
  <p>hotels cost more and the roads are complicated. </p>
  <p>It will be very nice If I can stay in little town like this everyday. </p>
  <p>I will wake up at five thirty tomorrow since the day will be bright at that time </p>
  <p>and riding in early morning is very relaxing.</p>
