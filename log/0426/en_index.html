  <p class="style5">My Eyes~~ Keep Blowing~~</p>
  <p>I strictly carried out my early bird principal so I woke up at four in the morning. </p>
  <p>The day was getting bright already. God, the sun is coming out so early?</p>
  <p> I lay back for a while more and woke up before five and started to pack. </p>
  <p>Yang sir told me yesterday that the road to Xian will not be easy. </p>
  <p>There’s about 1000Km to go and it’s full of coal trucks. The road is full of coal dust so after riding for a day your face will be all black. </p>
  <p>He told me that when he went to restaurant the waiter laughed at him about the face.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The outspoken and energetic Yang sir left at five thirty. </p>
  <p>I didn’t fall much behind. I left one hour later. </p>
  <p>His destination is Beijing, 160Km away and my destination is Shihjuazhuang (Family Shih Village) also 160Km away. </p>
  <p>It’s actually very easy to get there. </p>
  <p>SI just have to keep going on the 107 National Freeway and don’t get off of it.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000643.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had the walnut cookies and water for breakfast. </p>
  <p>Not long after I started riding I saw a stand selling strawberries. Is it strawberry season already?</p>
  <p>I got water mouthed so I stopped and ask for the price.</p>
  <p>“10 bucks!”</p>
  <p>10 bucks for half kilogram is a little expensive but it is strawberry it supposes to be expensive. </p>
  <p>So I calculated, if 500 grams cost 10 bucks then it is 43 New Taiwanese (NT) and 100 grams is about 8 NT. </p>
  <p>It is still cheaper than Taiwan. </p>
  <p>The seller didn’t know what I was thinking so he added: “2.5Kg for 10 bucks!” </p>
  <p>Really? That’s so cheap.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000646.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Therefore I bought 5 bucks of strawberry which means I got 1 Kg of strawberries with only 22 NT. </p>
  <p>I ride and eat strawberries along the way. </p>
  <p>At the beginning it tasted very good but after a while it started to get scary. </p>
  <p>I felt like I was in “Fear Factor” eating worms with red body juice splashing out when I bite it. </p>
  <p>I didn’t stop and after one hour I was glad that I finished the challenge.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>Riding in China is so different than riding bike in Taiwan. </p>
  <p>Most of people will encourage you and give you some moral support. </p>
  <p>About 98% of people will gaze at me when I pass by. </p>
  <p>About 60% of cars will look back on me when they pass by. </p>
  <p>About 3% of pedestrians will wave their hands, chat with me, cheer for me or just tell me to go slowly or “bon voyage”. </p>
  <p>It’s a warmth feeling. I am riding alone but I don’t feel lonely.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000665.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I feel that I have finished the strawberries that I will eat for my entire life. That’s enough. </p>
  <p>About eleven I wanted to eat something salty to balance out the strawberries. </p>
  <p>I ordered beef noodle, the noodle is wider than fettuccini, with some vegetable with gravy. </p>
  <p>Noodle cost 3 bucks and since one egg cost 50 cents I ordered two to get a whole number.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000654.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just like usual I was asked if I wanted beer. “Well, I will have one”. </p>
  <p>This time is not Snow Flake brand beer instead I had “Bitter Gourd” brand. </p>
  <p>The name is so interesting. The beer is so bitter what is good about it? </p>
  <p>Just like the lines in the movie “Confession of Pain”: “The good part of the beer is that it taste bitter and bad.” </p>
  <p>Well said. Since I drink beer like water, I will take it like source of hydration.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000653.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I slept in the dinner for half a hour after I finished my noodle. </p>
  <p>The sun is not strong today, however it was blowing sand constantly. </p>
  <p>Did I get so lucky to encounter a sandstorm? </p>
  <p>Sunglasses are very useful; besides blocking UV light it also blocks the “Kamikaze” of the flying bugs and the airborne sands. <br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was so boring riding on 107 freeway today. </p>
  <p>I played music from my iPod otherwise I wouldn’t know how to entertain myself. </p>
  <p>I arrived to Zhengding County at three in the afternoon. </p>
  <p>The sandstorm was getting stronger and I almost can’t see the road. </p>
  <p>Sands flew in the air becoming alive just like a science fiction movie.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000666.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I wanted to eat something and there were a lot of pineapple stands along the way. </p>
  <p>They cut the pineapple in spiral shape then split it in 4 equal pieces and used poked it with a chopstick. </p>
  <p>1 bucks per piece. I chat with the boss while I ate a piece. </p>
  <p>He asked me how long I will take to ride to Xian. I told him about two weeks. </p>
  <p>He told me that he will try to ride back to Xian on his next vacation. </p>
  <p>The boss is from Xian and came here to work.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000678.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I arrived at Shihjiazhuang before four o’clock. </p>
  <p>The buildings here are all one floor high, to be a little more exact it’s 1.5 floors high. </p>
  <p>They all sold hardware, motors, plastics and repair parts. </p>
  <p>None of them had sign but every store described their products in a board as big as the store front. </p>
  <p>The sandstorm didn’t fade after I got to the city, instead mixed with the chaotic traffic made it very annoying. <br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000682.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I rode as fast as I could to get out of the city. </p>
  <p>Everything is more expensive in the city so I decided to ride a little more to get out of the city and find some place cheaper to stay and eat.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While I was looking for hotel I saw a stand selling my favorite snack, fried dough twist. </p>
  <p>When I approached the stand I was amazed by the huge size of the dough twist. </p>
  <p>It was as thick as a electrical pole. </p>
  <p>The owner let me taste each flavor and explained that there is 8 bucks, 10 bucks and 12 bucks per half kilogram. </p>
  <p>I chose one that is between soft and hard with sesame dressing which cost me 10 bucks. </p>
  <p>Then the owner weighted some more and told me to have it for 16 bucks. </p>
  <p>I liked to eat dough twist but I think I will last a few days eating it for breakfast now. <br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000684.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Around five in the afternoon after I left Shihjiazhuang I found a hotel called “Best Point Hotel” which cost 10 bucks per night. </p>
  <p>The owner’s last name is Jia. Jia sir asked me for identification but I told him that previous days hotels didn’t ask it, </p>
  <p>besides I will pay you so let’s avoid the hazard. I easily avoided the problem of Taiwanese Permit. <br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I also asked Jia sir if the sandstorm will keep blowing everyday. </p>
  <p>He told me that every year during spring the sandstorm comes once for about 4~5 days. </p>
  <p>Only once a year and I got to “enjoy” it, what a luck! </p>
  <p>I took Dido to the room and shake of a layer of sand. My jacket was full of it too even my face. <br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000691.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I ate beef pancake for tonight. </p>
  <p>I thought it was a pancake with beef filling but it actually was like some sort of Taco. </p>
  <p>Meat on the pancake with some cilantro on top and then bathed in gravy. </p>
  <p>That was 3 bucks per serving and then I ordered stuffed steam bun which cost 5 for 1 buck. </p>
  <p>Damn why it is so cheap or it’s because of me?<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000693.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>For dinner I also had a beer. </p>
  <p>I can’t drink beer with every meal. If I see sodas I will have that next time.</p>
  <p><br />
  When I blew my nose it came out black from the sandstorm. These days when I blew my nose, </p>
  <p>usually I can only find some tiny bug’s dead body but when I saw black mucus I really don’t know if I should laugh or cry. <br />
