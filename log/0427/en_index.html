  <p class="style5">I am Good at Playing Poor</p>
  <p>Madam Jia, the owner’s wife, asked me if I wanted breakfast. </p>
  <p>I still have a bunch of dough twist so I declined her offer. </p>
  <p>After all I still bought 4 sesame pancakes which cost 5 cents each. I ate one for breakfast it was as hard as a brick. </p>
  <p>One must have very good teeth to eat it. The rest I will keep it for provision. </p>
  <p>My stomach complained once I finished the pancake. </p>
  <p>It protested why I had to eat such thing so difficult to digest.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000701.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It’s about 90Km far to Xingtai now is six thirty; I believe I will get there at noon for lunch.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000702.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am still taking the 107 freeway. There are trees full of branches and leaves planted along the way for about 30Km.</p>
  <p> It was very refreshing to ride on this section.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000717.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I cover myself as much as I can on this journey since I don’t want to become a charcoal like other trips. </p>
  <p>I wear my long sleeve dry tex shirt and a jacket to cover myself from the sun. </p>
  <p>I was wearing shorts but my legs are getting dark already so I started to wear the long black lycra pants underneath. </p>
  <p>Therefore I am totally covered. </p>
  <p>The only place I am exposed to the mercy of sun is my face and my fingers outside of my gloves.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>Nothing special happened on the way, so I rode and listened to music. </p>
  <p>I arrived at Xingtai according to my plan at twelve. </p>
  <p>I feel that this is a nice place even though I was only passing by. I liked the place.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000719.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I chose a buffet stand along the way. I could choose from a variety of 20 hot and cold dishes. </p>
  <p>I took a serving of braised pork and rice. </p>
  <p>The owner told me that the pork cost 7 bucks so I shouted in an exaggerated voice “it cost 7 bucks!!” </p>
  <p>Immediately I got a discount even though I didn’t feel it was expensive. </p>
  <p>So I spent 7.5 bucks for the pork and the rice.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000733.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I took a share table between the buffet stand and the cold noodle stand. </p>
  <p>I chat with the owner for a little and people started to gather around. </p>
  <p>Those who were eating and other salesman, they all gathered around to ask me about the journey and touch Dido. </p>
  <p>They were very enthusiastic but I started to get nervous about their enthusiasm. </p>
  <p>I remained calm and finished this delicious food.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once I finished I thanked them all and went on my way to avoid the crowd. </p>
  <p>I also bought a stick of pineapple for dessert. </p>
  <p>I kept riding and I saw an internet cafe’s sign just when I was about to leave Xingtai.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000738.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is the first internet cafe that I see in China. </p>
  <p>Finally I can get online so I entered and asked: “I have my laptop, can I use your connection?” </p>
  <p>The clerk shook his head. I didn’t know if he meant can’t or don’t know. </p>
  <p>“I have a portable hard disk can I connect it to your computer?” </p>
  <p>The clerk shook his head again. I still didn’t know what he meant.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I guess I will just try and find out. One hour of internet cost 2 bucks, </p>
  <p>I don’t know if that’s expensive or not at least I can afford it. </p>
  <p>So I took my bike into the internet cafe fearing that when I am concentrated on the computer someone might come and take it. </p>
  <p>The pancakes from this morning fall off when I was taking out my laptop. </p>
  <p>The clerk heard the dropping sound and asked me: “You only eat this for your journey?”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That’s great!! I succeeded to give people a poor impression! </p>
  <p>That’s a very strong encouragement.</p>
  <p>“Yes I have to ride for a few months so I have to save the money.If not I won’t have enough for the journey.”<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I proceeded to detect wireless internet. </p>
  <p>Of course they won’t have that here. No success.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Then I tried to connect the ADSL cable to my laptop. Failed, because the cable was too short.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then let me just copy my blog to the external hard disk and then connect the hard disk to their computer. </p>
  <p>Failed too, because their computer doesn’t recognize my external hard disk.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I thought with my three strategies I wouldn’t fail to upload the blog but seems like I am wrong. </p>
  <p>I guess it’s because my external hard disk was not receiving enough power to be recognized. </p>
  <p>As last resource, I remembered that I have iPod. </p>
  <p>I just use iPod as a memory device and copied all my blogs to iPod and then to the computer. </p>
  <p>Finally successful. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Finally I can upload my blogs for the last five days. </p>
  <p>At the same time reported my well being to my family, Misasa and my friends. </p>
  <p>And I can share the events with everybody and let you all see the world through my eyes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>Too bad that the computer only had simplified Chinese input program. </p>
  <p>I only could read the Emails and messages but I couldn’t type traditional Chinese. </p>
  <p>I hid myself from the sun in the internet cafe for about an hour. </p>
  <p>The uploading speed was pretty fast, 40 or so MB, so I only spent 10 minutes uploading.</p>
  <p> I will have daily blogs however I don’t think I can upload daily. Once a week will be fine.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>China is a place with a lot of bike riders. </p>
  <p>Among this people there are about 15~20% with electrical bike (estimated by sight). </p>
  <p>It is also a very good substitute for motorcycles. </p>
  <p>It is quiet and easy to ride. Above all it’s very pro environment. </p>
  <p>Bicycles in advanced countries such as Europe, is a trend but in developing countries such as China it represents life. </p>
  <p>What about in Taiwan? It actually is a test. Who would really like to fight with a bunch of cars and motorcycles for road? </p>
  <p>If you don’t have a strong heart you really can’t commute with a bicycle in a big city (Taipei). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I was riding today, I spent a lot of time day dreaming. </p>
  <p>I only allowed a little portion of my brain to watch the uneven road and avoid the gravels.</p>
  <p>My butt hurt so much that I almost lost my feelings. </p>
  <p>I am about to go into “bum of steel” state. </p>
  <p>It’s very usual to ride into a road that is excavated exaggeratedly, so I have to walk through.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000710.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I saw a donkey pulling a cart with vegetables on my way. </p>
  <p>When the boss was gone the donkey started to eat the vegetables that it was carrying.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000745.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Around five o’clock I arrive at Handan, the background city for the movie “The Battle of Wits”. </p>
  <p>In which described how the Mohist Gerlit protected the people of Liang by protecting the city’s castle. </p>
  <p>However there’s no sign of a castle in this city anymore. Generally speaking, this is a modern city that will attract most peoples. </p>
  <p>It’s larger than I imagined. The modern part of the city is very fashioned and tidy that makes you feel you are not in China. <br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000757.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The old part of the city remains very traditional. </p>
  <p>It seems like time didn’t leave its trail on this part of the city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000762.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I rode around and around. I am amazed for the variety of facets in China. </p>
  <p>I won’t have opportunity on this journey to go to the cities along the coast. </p>
  <p>I believe their lives must be even more vivid and interesting.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Along the way I saw a beverage store, something very rare in China, adding to that it sells Bubble Tea. </p>
  <p>Since Bubble Tea is originated from Taiwan so it announces that it’s Taiwanese Bubble Tea. </p>
  <p>Even the brand resembles a Taiwanese bubble tea chain store “Quickly”. </p>
  <p>It is so funny. A glass about 300cc of bubble tea cost 1 buck. </p>
  <p>This is the first time I complain about the quantity of things I buy in China. Fortunately it is not a big glass. </p>
  <p>It doesn’t taste a bit like bubble tea. It tastes more like almond juice with caramel. </p>
  <p>It is not bad if you don’t call it a bubble tea.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000761.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>From the clerks I got information that a little street ahead is full of cheap dorms. </p>
  <p>Just like they told me, one by one lined up with signs outside. </p>
  <p>You can compare the prices until you find the one that suits you.</p>
  <p> I decided to stay the night on the one that has a grocery shop outside. </p>
  <p>It costs 15 bucks. Other dorms wanted to charge me 30 because they said that it’s a double room. </p>
  <p>Hey, but it is you who doesn’t offer single room, I am only one person. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000773.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The grocery shop’s room is a quadruple equipped with some nice stuff such as television for me to enjoy some voices.</p>
  <p> I organized my stuffs and washed my jacket that is getting dirtier every day and then I went out for food hunting.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000769.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I chose a restaurant that looked nice. Besides me, there were a bunch of students eating. </p>
  <p>I ordered one fried rice or chao fan (2.5 bucks) and a Tofu spicy sour soup (5 bucks). </p>
  <p>I took a lot of napkins after I ate. I didn’t bring tissue papers this time so everyday when I stopped at a place I will take some.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000774.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After dinner I walked around to digest my food. Nobody laid eyes on me since I was dressed raggedly. </p>
  <p>When I rode my bike everybody looked at me like an alien. </p>
  <p>I take out my sunglasses, my babushka and I only wear my shorts and the slippers after I ride. </p>
  <p>My dress code looked poorer than anyone else walking around and that helped me to avoid peculiar sights.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now I am waking up earlier and departing earlier. As consequences I am able to find a place to stay earlier. </p>
  <p>I am doing well at my time management. However since I am waking up earlier I feel sleepy after nine. </p>
  <p>So sleep I go zzZZz.<br />
