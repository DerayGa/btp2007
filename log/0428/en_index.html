  <p class="style5">The Scenery along the River</p>
  <p>Late at night, heavy knocking on the door, “Brother, are you asleep yet?  Can you open the door….,” </p>
  <p>After several knockings on the door, the door opened.  </p>
  <p>I woke up and thought this must be a robbery.  Looked up and realized it was Mr. Big Beard (the hotel owner).  </p>
  <p>Come to find out there were more people checked in and not enough blankets, so he needed to get more blankets from my room.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looked at the watch and it was 11:40 pm.  People just checking in now?  </p>
  <p>That is too pitiful.  I hope I will never be in that situation looking a place to stay in the middle of night.  </p>
  <p>I then fell right back to sleep in a few seconds.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Normally the checkout time at hotels is12:00 pm or maybe 11:00 am, I thought.  At 6:00 early in the morning, </p>
  <p>as I was putting all the bags back on Dido and tying my headscarf, Mr. Big Beard walked in again. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>“Are you leaving now, brother?”</p>
  <p>Yeeeessss…. I will leave in about 5 minutes…. Why?</p>
  <p>“Oh, nothing, someone is checking in and this room is the only room I have left”</p>
  <p>Took a peak outside, there were a man and a woman waiting outside.  </p>
  <p>What is going on here?  People either checking in in the middle of night or early in the morning.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Luckily I get up very early these days, otherwise, </p>
  <p>I don’t think I will feel too good to be woken up early in the morning and to be kicked out of the room.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000785.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Took the bike over to Mr. Big Beard’s grocery store and asked him to fill up the water bottles for me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I then bought 2 bags of milk for breakfast, one RMB for each bag.  </p>
  <p>Although the plastic packaging looks kind of strange, but it is very convenient to tear off one corner with my teeth and then drink from it.  </p>
  <p>The taste is not too bad, either.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000786.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I left Handan , a mixture of modern and ancient city, in the morning.  </p>
  <p>This is the last city I stayed in Hebei Province. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000787.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Actually by looking at the car license plate, you would know which region you are in. </p>
  <p>When I was in Beijing, all the license plates have Jingon them.</p>
  <p> After leaving urban area of Beijing, they became Ji , which is the abbreviation of Hebei Province. <br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000790.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Continued riding toward south approximately 50 km is the boarder between Henan and Hebei.  </p>
  <p>There is no special sign here; just a gate indicates you are entering Henan.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once entering Henan, most of license plates now have Yu  on them, the abbreviation of Henan Province.  </p>
  <p>Not only the license plates are different, so does the dialect.  </p>
  <p>My imitated Beijing dialect is no longer useful because people here don’t use Beijing dialect, instead now is Henan dialect.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Also I can’t say I am from Beijing anymore.  </p>
  <p>Before Beijing wasn’t that far from Hebei Province and telling people that I am from Beijing didn’t draw that much attention.  </p>
  <p>But now, if I said I am from Beijing, there will be a big announcement,</p>
  <p> “Come here!  Hurry!  This guy rode his bike from Beijing!” </p>
  <p>Then there is a series of questions.  How far have you ridden the bike? </p>
  <p>For how many days? </p>
  <p>What do you do? </p>
  <p>Where are you going? </p>
  <p>Where are you from?  </p>
  <p>None stop questions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So now when I answer these questions, just like getting caught by the ticket checkers on the trains, </p>
  <p>when they asked which stop did you get on, the standard answer is always from the previous stop. </p>
  <p>”I am from Handan.”</p>
  <p>But it doesn’t quite work here, either.  </p>
  <p>This is because Handan is in Hebei and I am in Henan now, so it still feels very far away.  </p>
  <p>But at least it doesn’t draw as much attention compare with before.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000804.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>At noon, I had lunch in Anyang .  Lunch was sweet bean sauce noodle and stir fry bean sprouts.  </p>
  <p>If this is the real sweet bean sauce noodle, </p>
  <p>I don’t know what kind of sweet bean sauce noodle I have been eaten my whole life. </p>
  <p>It didn’t come with black-colored sauce, instead it has a mixture of scramble eggs, bean curd, </p>
  <p>tempura and lots of vegetable in broth to spread on top of noodle.  </p>
  <p>It was super delicious.  I didn’t want to just have a simple lunch, so I ordered stir fry bean sprouts.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When the dish came out, it was only bean sprouts, cooked with hot pepper and some sort of unknown ingredient that tasted sour.  </p>
  <p>Although it was very good, but when I ordered bean sprouts and it came with bean sprouts only, </p>
  <p>I didn’t know why I felt something was missing?  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000798.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Was it because the whole Jah Jah Men only cost 3.50 RMB and a bean sprouts dish cost 4 RMB, so I expected more from it?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The restaurant owner asked me if I wanted beer?  I said do you have cola?</p>
  <p>Yes, but it’s no cold.  I asked her to put a bottle of cola in the refrigerator so it would be cold when finishing lunch and some rest.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After lunch, I took a nap until 12:30 pm and then continued riding toward south.</p>
  <p>Today, the wind was blowing against me the whole day, so the riding speed was very slow.  </p>
  <p>The speedometer fluctuated between 10 – 13 km/h. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was riding in a slow pace, so I just followed a street vendor who rode a bike that carried many small items.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000807.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was slowly riding the bike for whole day.  </p>
  <p>Nothing interesting or strange things happened so I started daydreaming again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A hundred years ago, in 1907, the motor challenge from Beijing to Paris announced the upcoming automobile era.  </p>
  <p>Today, a hundred years later, I am asking myself, what kind of future are we leaving behind for our children?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A hundred years from now after we are gone, in 2107, </p>
  <p>when people look back, what kind of reviews are they going to give us.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It has been thousand of years since human race have history.  </p>
  <p>During this time, a lot of things have happened.  </p>
  <p>Mankind has created a lot of wonderful music, arts and cuisines.</p>
  <p> Of course we also have done a lot of idiotic things, such as wars and invading to other countries.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But looking back at the thousand years of history, which era do we really hate?  </p>
  <p>Even World War II, there are still a lot of stories people relish about.</p>
  <p>Not to mention the fascinating stories from the era of exploration of sea, Three Kingdoms   and Warring States Periods .</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The only exception is “Today”.</p>
  <p>“Today” is an ironic era.  It is the first time human race promotes environment protection.  </p>
  <p>At the same time, it is the era that has destroyed our environment the most.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>What are we leaving behind for our future generations a hundred years later?</p>
  <p>Is it going to be the era where they can only see polar bear in specimens at the museums?</p>
  <p>Is it going to be the era where they can only see Arctic through the documentary films?</p>
  <p>Is it going to be the era with abnormal climate changes, many biological extinctions and sadness only?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the science fiction movies, whenever they mentioned about the future, the majority of films have cars flew in the sky.</p>
  <p>Why are the cars flying in the sky?</p>
  <p>It must be because the roads can’t handle the traffic volume so in order to accommodate that many cars, cars have to fly.</p>
  <p>But do we really need that many cars?</p>
  <p><br />
  Frankly, cars are supposed to be a transportation tool.  </p>
  <p>If public transit is good, who wants to spend time to learn how to drive, </p>
  <p>spend significant savings to buy cars, buy more and more expensive gas, </p>
  <p>wasting time looking for parking space, paying one ticket after another one and endless maintenance on the cars? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A hundred year later, when people looking back at us, </p>
  <p>will they give us“hatred” review because our era is the most destructive era ever in the human history.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If we don’t do anything right now to change all this, </p>
  <p>we will have to spend a hundred times or even a thousand times more efforts to change this.</p>
  <p>When polar bears become distinct, how much effort will it take to reproduce one?</p>
  <p>If people ask me what will I go after finishing this bike tour?</p>
  <p>I will probably say to Arctic and apologize to polar bears.  </p>
  <p>Because of me not doing anything causing them become distinct.</p>
  <p>It’s not because what I have done that is killing them, </p>
  <p>but because I have the opportunity to do something and I feel it’s not of my business.</p>
  <p><br />
  Able to do something, but not doing anything causing harms to them.</p>
  <p>Bystanders are guilty, too, isn’t it?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Guilty for what?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A hundred years later when they judge our era.  </p>
  <p>If they say the Earth becomes the way it is because of these people. </p>
  <p>These people should be hated, condemned and even cursed.  </p>
  <p>Then I think we are all need to share this responsibility.</p>
  <p>I remembered when I was in the military service.  At the beginning of training, </p>
  <p>I was a rookie.  I saw several squad leaders were disassembling over a hundred guns before delivering to them other units.  </p>
  <p>While these squad leaders were chatting and disassembling the guns, a commander walked in and said </p>
  <p>“You idiots, how long is this going to take? Why don’t you gather the soldiers to help?  </p>
  <p>One soldier per gun and this will be taking care of in 3 minutes.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Those squad leaders were actually doing something and why did they get yelled at?  </p>
  <p>Was it because the method they did it with was incorrect or they had wrong attitude or wrong approach?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some might said </p>
  <p>“Deray, you stupid idiot.  Do you think you can stop global warming by riding the bike by yourself?  </p>
  <p>It will be more effective if I keep my refrigerator door opened!”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The CEO of General Motor or Ford might say, </p>
  <p>“Hey, what is this Taiwanese guy doing?  Who does he think he is?  Does he think he can influence automobile industry?”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Of course, one person is definitely not enough and I never though that I can save the Earth by myself.  </p>
  <p>But if by participating this campaign can influence more people want to ride bikes.  </p>
  <p>Let Taiwan become a better environment for bicyclists.  </p>
  <p>Let the whole world know that Taiwan is not a “Greed Island”, but a “Green Island”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Let the future generations have an opportunity to see a live polar bear.</p>
  <p> Let the children can have a dream to become an Arctic explorer, not an Arctic archaeologist.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Time flies when your mind is wondering all over the places.  </p>
  <p>Now its’ 4:00 pm and I have just arrived in a city.</p>
  <p> I looked up the sign, it is a place called Hebi  and I couldn’t find it on the map.</p>
  <p><br />
    My knees were getting sore.  </p>
  <p>Even though time flies when you are daydreaming, but that doesn’t make the distance short and riding easier.</p>
  <p>I saw a big sign said “Lodging”, so I walked over there with my bike and checked the price.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000809.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The response is no longer in the familiar Beijing dialect, but the thick Henan dialect.  </p>
  <p>Wait until I master this dialect and then I can pretend I am from Henan.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The lady from the counter asked me where I came from.  </p>
  <p>I said I started from Handan.  She asked how far was it?  </p>
  <p>Looked at the speedometer, it indicated 110 km.  </p>
  <p>Told her exactly that and she was very happy and asked me if I was tired?  Need to rest?  </p>
  <p>And then show me the room.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This is a European-class hotel.  Clean single bed, specious room, a color TV with cable, even a sofa, </p>
  <p>a console table and AC and heating unit.  </p>
  <p>Not to mention the chamber-pot sitting in the corner.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000811.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is best room I have stayed in so far and I was worried if it’s too expensive.  </p>
  <p>The old lady said that since I was such a brave soul riding bike all the way from Handan to here, </p>
  <p>she can charge me only 20 RMB.  Convert to NT that is less than 100 NT.  </p>
  <p>And there is a free public shower room!  </p>
  <p>I dropped everything and picked up my dirty clothes along with towel and soap and rushed to the shower room. <br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000815.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Wow!  It is a real shower room! </p>
  <p>Wow!  There is running hot water!</p>
  <p>Wow!  It is a real shower room!  </p>
  <p>(I know I said this already, but I am just too excited.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It has been a week since the beginning of the trip and this is the first time I could take a real and comfortable shower.</p>
  <p>Washed and rinsed the windbreaker.  This piece of clothing will be the indicator of how dirty I am.  </p>
  <p>Hopefully when I arrive in Paris, I can still tell this original color of this cloth is blue and grey.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Dinner is been taking care of at the restaurant right next to the hotel.  </p>
  <p>It is a decent restaurant, even the wait staff are wearing uniforms.  </p>
  <p>Looked at the menu, prices were ranging between 10 to 20 RMB, some are even 30 RMB. </p>
  <p>Pricing is not the absolute, but relative.  </p>
  <p>Although the most expensive dish here is about the same price as the stir fry at the street vendor in Taiwan. </p>
  <p>But after experienced the living standard here, </p>
  <p>suddenly seeing a dish that costs almost one day’s allowance, I still feel it was too expensive. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I ordered a bowl of braised noodle and got a bowl of noodle soup.  </p>
  <p>Not only it has the regular noodle in there, it also had rice noodle and bean curd.  </p>
  <p>The soup is made of pork stock.  This big bowl of soup was very filling and only cost 4 RMB. </p>
  <p><br />
    At night, I watched some TV, read a book and had a good night sleep.</p>
  <p>The old lady asked me for and ID, I told her that I left it at home and can I just write my information down? </p>
  <p>And no problem. </p>
  <p>I wondered if I show her my Taiwanese ID, how much is going to cost me for this comfortable room?</p>
