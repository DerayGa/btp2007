  <p class="style5">Heavenly Sent Yellow River</p>
  <p>I didn’t know what was wrong with the weather.  </p>
  <p> was very hazy in the morning but it didn’t feel like it was going to rain,</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000819.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A few minutes after I departed, I heard someone saying hello from the back.  </p>
  <p>I turned around, there was someone riding a bike, too.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000820.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>His name is Lee Jih-Min.  He is riding from Zhengzhou, Henan to Beijing, Hebei.  </p>
  <p>It will only take him 10 days to make a round trip if he rides 150 kilometers a day.</p>
  <p>He is riding a bike made by Merida.  He must not an amateur.  Come to find out, not only he is going to Beijing for pleasure, </p>
  <p>Merida is also sponsoring him and he will get some prices from the company if he finishes this trip.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I saw him riding casually with a red bike and red gears; I thought he must be a young man.</p>
  <p>I told him I am 27 years old and how old are you?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>“I am 40 years old… I have a son already.”</p>
  <p>What! You take care yourself very well!</p>
  <p>“It’s not take care of myself well, is covering myself well.”</p>
  <p>Indeed, look at him wearing a mask to cover his whole face.  This way he is not afraid of blowing sand and getting his face dirty.</p>
  <p>I am envy he has a mask.  But since I didn’t bring one, I will have to forget about it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Originally I was planning to take advantage of the coolness of early morning to cover as much distance as possible, </p>
  <p>so I deliberately rode very quick in order to pass him.</p>
  <p>“I will go first… I need to get to Zhengzhou today.”</p>
  <p>Less than 3 minutes later, it was his turn to pass me.  So I have to say I want to ride slow so I can enjoy the scenery along the way.</p>
  <p>“Brother Lee, you go first… :-)”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I got stuck in a ridiculous traffic jam.  Whole bunch of trucks and trackers all got stuck in the road.  </p>
  <p>Then every one was driving on the dirt road.</p>
  <p>That made things even worst.  There was no space for me to ride.  So I had to get off and walked in the dusty air. </p>
  <p>I walked for a few hundred meters and then found out there were two roads merging into one up front </p>
  <p>and there were many cars on both sides but neither side seems willing to budge.</p>
  <p> So every one just got stuck in the intersection.</p>
  <p>I don’t know how long this traffic jam is going to last.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000832.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Some tractors carried a huge pile of hays.  From the back you can only see a stack of hays moving.  Very funny.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000844.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After riding 107 national freeway for a few days, all the sudden, it disappeared today.  </p>
  <p>Unknowingly, I got on “Xinzheng First Class Highway.”</p>
  <p>From the name itself, this must be the road from Xinxiang to Zhengzhou.  But what is “First Class”?</p>
  <p>The English translation is “First Class Highway”, is it a Highway?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000848.jpg" width="899" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I saw the barriers start appearing on both sides of the road and an “EXIT” sign every 10 km or so.</p>
  <p>Then there was the rest area in half way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Did I get on the highway by accident again?</p>
  <p>Even though that was very possible, but no one was stopping me on this very much likely to be a highway.</p>
  <p>The only reason I am continue riding because I didn’t see any sign indicated bicycles are prohibited.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Maybe China is the most suitable country to travel by bikes.  </p>
  <p>In China, except highways and railroads, you can pretty much ride on any roads.</p>
  <p>Some roads will not allow tricycles, horse-drawn carriages, tractors, motorcycles, trucks and rickshaws.  </p>
  <p>But I haven’t seen any roads prohibit bikes. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Like yesterday, it was a slightly headwind weather.On this first class highway, I didn’t get off from any exits.</p>
  <p>So I will pass Xinxiang and head to the destination Zhengzhou.</p>
  <p>On this first class highway, except for exits, there were no restaurants and vendors so I didn’t have anything to eat.</p>
  <p>At noon, I stopped at Xinxiang rest area.  In this huge ruin like lonely rest area,</p>
  <p> I ordered some fast food for 10 RMB, one portion of meat and two portions of vegetables, from a lady who looked sleepier than me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000851.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I brought the tray to a table that was closest to Dido, </p>
  <p>just as I was getting ready to start eating, the sleepy server said “Do not split on the floor”</p>
  <p>Do I really look that messy? </p>
  <p>Why is she telling me specifically not to split on the floor?  Do I look like someone will do that?</p>
  <p>I turned around and forced a smile at her and started my lunch.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>With the rate I am going, if bikes are allowed on this first class highway and I don’t get stopped by the police, </p>
  <p>I should be able to get to Zhengzhou, a pretty big city in the central China, before 5 o’clock.</p>
  <p>After arrive Zhengzhou, I will have a whole day to rest.  I can wandering around or sleep for a whole day to recover.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At 3:30 in the afternoon, I arrived at the Yellow River Bridge.</p>
  <p>I remembered then, how come I didn’t see the river when I was riding from Hebei (means north of river) to Henan (means south of river), </p>
  <p>since I was supposed crossing the river?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before got on the Yellow River Bridge, there were signs indicated pedestrian and bikes are prohibited.  I asked the guard on the bridge.</p>
  <p>“How can I cross the bridge with a bike?” and pointed to the two signs prohibiting me and Dido to pass.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000857.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The guard was very cool.  He looked exactly like Chinese, but when he spoke, he sounded like a Spanish person speaking Chinese.</p>
  <p>Is that how you speak Hanan accent by mimicking a foreigner speaking Chinease?  That’s not too difficult.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The guard said this is a narrow bridge and with traffic in high speed, I should not be riding.  It’s too dangerous.</p>
  <p>What! If I can’t ride then how do I cross the river.  </p>
  <p>Is there another way to cross the Yellow River?  Do I just walk Dido over the bridge?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That was it.  That was the solution.  </p>
  <p>Even though pedestrians and bikes are prohibited, but it does not prohibit a pedestrian walk a bike to cross the bridge.</p>
  <p>I really didn’t understand this logic.  But since the guard said so, I would just do so.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Walking the bike cross the bridge, there was wheat planted below the bridge.</p>
  <p>All these days, there was wheat planted along the roads.</p>
  <p>From far way, you can’t tell the difference between wheat and aquatic rice plantation.  </p>
  <p>Until you get close and you will find the soil was dry unlike aquatic rice must be planted in paddy field.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000829.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The wheat plantation extended endlessly, the bridge seemed very long.  </p>
  <p>I didn’t know when I would be able to finish walking across this bridge.</p>
  <p>After walked for half hour, I started riding again along the sidewalk on the bridge and moving steadily.</p>
  <p>I though the Yellow River must be very wide with roaring waves and flow into the sea with grandeur.  </p>
  <p>The river should be so wide that you can’t see the other side of the bank if you are standing on this side of the river. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000871.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But when I saw it in person, even though it was really wide, but still it is not as big as I though.</p>
  <p>But the water was extremely yellow, full of dirt.  </p>
  <p>The wheat plantation along the Yellow River must be planting on the deposits from the Yellow River.  An extraordinarily fertile plain.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000866.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Passed the Yellow River is Zhengzhou.  Riding on the Garden Road, it felt like one of those European boulevards.  </p>
  <p>You get a sense that the government want to develop Zhengzhou into a big city in the central China.  This will be a likeable place.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000878.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Strolled down the road and checked if there were any hotel signs.  Luckily I found the hotel streets.</p>
  <p>The street was full of loud Taiwanese pop music.  Young men were playing pools, bystanders were no longer paying any attention to me.</p>
  <p>I found a comfortable room for 30 RMB.  Because the room was very comfortable, so I decided to stay here for two nights.</p>
  <p>One night was 30 RMB, two nights were 55 RMB with 5 RMB discount, not bad at all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000880.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There was a screw loosen in Dido’s front rack and I couldn’t screw it back because the threads were already wear off.</p>
  <p>I will need to find a welding place tomorrow and ask them to weld all the screws in the front and back racks.  </p>
  <p>This way it will give me a peace of mind while riding the bike.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Dinner was taking care of at the night market.  </p>
  <p>The atmosphere was about the same as the night market in Taiwan with one exception, the price was much cheaper here.</p>
  <p>There were a lot of street vendors selling food.  It was a big struggle walking down the street because I want to try everything.</p>
  <p>Finally I picked a wonton vendor.  A big bowl of wonton soup was 3 RMB.  It was as big as a washbasin and filled with wontons.</p>
  <p>No wonder the woman making the wontons was so fast.  If she was slow, then they wouldn’t be able to serve all the customers.</p>
  <p>I counted while I was eating this big bowl of wonton soup.  There were total of 25 wontons (and I am stuffed).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before I got back, I bought a sweet potato weighted at least 1 kilogram (3 RMB) for snack when I watch TV and read a book.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While I was at the night market, I found an internet café.  </p>
  <p>If I have nothing to do tomorrow, I can spend some time here.  That’s if I can get Dido fixed first.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I am so blessed to plan some free days in this trip.</p>
  <p>Tomorrow let’s have a one day tour at the Yellow River!</p>
