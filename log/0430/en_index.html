  <p class="style5">An afternoon at Yellow River</p>
  <p>Today is a manic Monday.  When every one is getting ready for work, I am in Zhengzhou, China, relaxing.  </p>
  <p>Although I wanted to sleep in, but my biological clock woke me up at 5:00.  </p>
  <p>It’s a rare treat to stay in such comfortable room even though it was a little bit more expensive, </p>
  <p>but I felt like I am in a five-star hotel.  When I woke up, for a moment, I didn’t know where I was.</p>
  <p><br />
    There was not much I could do early in the morning.  </p>
  <p>So I went downstairs to have for a decent breakfast.  The area along the street I was staying is called “Liu Village” .  </p>
  <p>There are many hotels and restaurants.  When I walked downstairs, I found that the front metal gate was not even opened yet.  </p>
  <p>It appeared that I was the first person to wake up this morning.  </p>
  <p>When I stretched and yawned, I could smell the breakfast coming from somewhere near by. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000887.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I ordered a bowl of soybean milk and an order of four pan-fried biscuits.  </p>
  <p>The biscuits have round shapes with some unidentified fillings.  It tasted sweet.  </p>
  <p>I wanted to order something looked like small version of fried bread sticks, </p>
  <p>but they were sold by kilogram and that was just too much for me :(</p>
  <p>When the soybean milk came, I had a sip and it was horrible.  </p>
  <p>There was no sweetness to it.  It tasted more like sour soy milk.  </p>
  <p>I saw other people used their spoons to scoop a spoonful of sugar to mix in with their soybean milk so I did the same. </p>
  <p>What a relaxing breakfast.  I didn’t have to ride bike and eat breakfast at the same time.  </p>
  <p>I didn’t have to munching on the pathetic dry food.  Total cost of breakfast was 1.50 RMB, very inexpensive.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the morning, I brought Dido to the repair shop next to the hotel.  </p>
  <p>I tried to use Henan dialect by imitating foreigners speaking Chinese.  </p>
  <p>I told the owner that one of the screws in the front rack was loosed.  </p>
  <p>There were some wear on the screw so I couldn’t tighten it up. </p>
  <p>Can you weld it shut?  So it will be solid. </p>
  <p>Just in case, I asked him to weld all the other 7 screws that were still in tact.  </p>
  <p>I don’t think I ride back with these heavy bags on the back if the front rack breaks in the middle of nowhere.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000893.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I asked the owner for an estimate for welding all eight screws.  </p>
  <p>I pretended to be poor and had no money and hoped I could get a cheap price.</p>
  <p>And the owner only asked for 2 RMB and that was much cheaper than I expected :D</p>
  <p>I was holding Dido for the owner while he was welding the screws one by one.  </p>
  <p>Well, let’s consider this as “destructive maintenance”.</p>
  <p>When I arrive in Paris, how will I take the front rack off the bike to pack before shipping back to Taiwan? </p>
  <p>Oh well, that’s the problem won’t happen until half year later.  </p>
  <p>I will worry about it then.  It’s more important to fix the problem now.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000902.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After finished welding, I borrowed a bucket of water and a towel to clean the dirt off Dido slowly.</p>
  <p>It has only been a week and the bike was covered with a layer of dirt.  </p>
  <p>Carefully wiped down, Dido looked more like in its original appearance now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I have stored my travel logs in iPod and then upload them at Internet cafés.  </p>
  <p>It only cost 1 RMB per hour at the cheaper CRT screen area.</p>
  <p>Since there was nothing to do in the morning, I spent two hours there.  </p>
  <p>At the same time, I have uploaded travel logs up to 29th. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today is April 30th and tomorrow is May 1st.  In Taiwan, it is a one-day Labor Day holiday.  </p>
  <p>But in China, May 1st is the beginning of a long holiday week.</p>
  <p>Everyone in China is traveling, either going home or travel.  </p>
  <p>This is a busy and happy week.  As long as I will not get stock in traffic tomorrow, that is all that matter :(</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At 12:30 pm, rode Dido without all the bags and brought my camera and GPS.  </p>
  <p>The plan is to spend an afternoon at Yellow River scenic area. </p>
  <p>I thought the Yellow Riser was close, but ended up I had to ride almost an hour and half, approximately 25 km.  </p>
  <p>It’s like from SOGO on Chung Hsiao East Road  to the sandwich shop in Keelung .  Not close at all :(</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Originally I wanted to stop at the entrance.  Since bicycles are allowed inside, so I bought a ticket for 30 RMB.</p>
  <p>The ticket indicated this is an AAAA class tourist attraction.  </p>
  <p>FOUR A’s!  I was so looking forward to it, but very disappointed at the end : ( </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000906.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am going to save everyone 30 RMB.  </p>
  <p>Let me be your tour guide and it will only take 5 minutes to tour this four A’s class tourist attraction.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you first enter, </p>
  <p>you will see gigantic sculptures of Yen and Yellow Emperors (known as the founders of Chinese civilization) sitting on top of stones.  </p>
  <p>Are they carved out of stone, I wonder?  The lines are a little bit too clean. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000912.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then there is the observation lake.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000929.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are a few dozens of horses that you can pay a couple of RMB to take a picture of riding them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000916.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are many fishing boats selling fish.  Of course the fish are from the Yellow River.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000917.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Don’t know why there is a beat up aircraft.  </p>
  <p>Probably it’s for the parents to take pictures of their kids climbing up and down the aircraft.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000925.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There is a big square with a platform surrounded with ancient bronze instruments (Maybe???)</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000931.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>You can also buy some incense here to pay respects to Chinese ancestors.  </p>
  <p>There are many kinds of incense, from regular ones to sizes that are as tall as an adult.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000933.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And that’s all, folks.  That is what I spent 30 RMB for T_T</p>
  <p>Give me back my money.  I want to buy 30 pineapples on the stick with that money.</p>
  <p>What kind of four A’s class tourist attraction ~&quot;~</p>
  <p>If I have known I would stop at the entrance.  Only if I have known.  Luckily I only spent 30 RMB. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Back to the hotel and took a nice shower, packed all the bags, tomorrow my journey will start again.  </p>
  <p>This time it will be heading toward west.  South heading has come to an end. </p>
  <p>Dinner was taking care of at the side streets.  I saw some Islamic style baked biscuits.  </p>
  <p>It’s freshly made biscuits baked on top of a charcoal fire oven and they looked very crispy and smelled good.</p>
  <p>You can buy them just plain or with fillings.  The fillings are stir-fried bean sprouts, </p>
  <p>shredded carrots, diced green onions, and choices of hotdogs or pan-fried eggs.   </p>
  <p>Then we can eat with biscuits with the filling inside. </p>
  <p>I can not believe something so delicious costs only 1 RMB. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000943.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I bought another two of something looks like chicken nuggets on the stick, </p>
  <p>one sausage on a stick, one chicken liver on the stick and total cost just 3 RMB.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000945.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As I was eating and walking back to the hotel, all the sudden a rumble of thunders and the rain started pouring down.  </p>
  <p>It was a sunny afternoon, and the weather changed in a split second.</p>
  <p>Luckily it was a quick shower; otherwise, riding bike in the rain would be very uncomfortable @&quot;@</p>
