  <p class="style5">Touring the Ancient Capital</p>
  <p>Strolling down the streets of Louyang in the morning, surprisingly, </p>
  <p>you can’t find that restaurants open for breakfast.  Wondering around, finally found a restaurant filled with steam from steamers.</p>
  <p>I ordered a bowl of eight-treasure rice soup, according to the boss lady.  </p>
  <p>But it was not sweet at all : ( and they wouldn’t add sugar for me, either.</p>
  <p>Also saw the steamers have steamed meat buns and they looked delicious.  Asked for price, 0.4 RMB for 1 bun.</p>
  <p>She brought me one tray and it had 10 buns.  The boss lady asked me if I can finish them.</p>
  <p>Can anyone eat 10 steamed buns first thing in the morning?</p>
  <p>I ordered 5 of them.  Plus a bowl of non-sweet eight-treasure rice soup for breakfast.  Total 2.5 RMB.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After breakfast, got on Dido and headed to bookstore, just like the travel agent said, to buy a map of Louyang.  One map, 2 RMB.  </p>
  <p>That was a little bit expensive.  It was just a piece of paper. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010010.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I asked the owner to mark my current location on the map.  </p>
  <p>This was just in case if I get lost and can’t find my way back to the hotel.  That would be embarrassing.</p>
  <p>Next, asked how to get to the old town of Louyang.</p>
  <p>Come to find out the old town has become the “Sui Tang Dynasties Ruins Botanical Garden”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Louyang is also known as ancient capital of nine dynasties.  According to Chinese history, </p>
  <p>there were at least thirteen dynasties, Xia, Shang, Eastern Zhou, Eastern Han, Cao Wei, West Jin, Norhtern Wei, Sui and Tang, </p>
  <p>named Louyang as the capital.  Louyang had been the capital for 1529 years and it is the oldest capital in Chinese history. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Passed through a big bridge – Louyang Bridge with Lou River flow below it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010013.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010027.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Followed the map and found the entrance to the Old Town without any problem and it’s free!</p>
  <p>I was excited and ready to get in.  One of employees stopped me and said bicycles are not allowed inside and I have to leave it outside. </p>
  <p>Well, how could I part with Dido?  I could not leave him here and go inside by myself.</p>
  <p>In that case, let’s say I have been here even though I stopped at the entrance.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010025.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I have been riding Dido all morning in downtown.  There were a lot of buses and the city was well developed.</p>
  <p>City landscape was very greenery and had a similar feeling as Ta-an district in Taipei.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010038.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>At 10:30, after wondering around, I was going to go to the White Horse Temple, a must visit tourist attraction. </p>
  <p>But if they wouldn’t allow bicycles inside, I would have to stop at the entrance again and it would be ashamed.</p>
  <p>So my plan was to take a bus in the afternoon so it wouldn’t be a waste of trip.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010044.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I saw a cute little girl riding backward on her mom’s bike.  Actually this is very scary.  </p>
  <p>Those who have ridden backward on motorcycles would know.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010046.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On the side walk, there were many old men playing Chinese chess.  </p>
  <p>All the pieces were huge and there were a lot of audiences.</p>
  <p>Here, evidently the rule of bystanders are not allowed to give any suggestions didn’t exists.  </p>
  <p>Everyone had his own option on what the next move should be and they were very excited about it.</p>
  <p>They weren’t afraid to give any tactical advices.  Some were even cursing unrelentingly if a bad move was made.  </p>
  <p>That’s because the rule of can not retracting a move is still valid here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010051.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On the way back to the hotel, I bought a roast chicken (15 RMB).  Just by looking at it made my mouth watering.</p>
  <p>The same restaurant also sells hot and spicy rabbit meat.  But I wouldn’t dare to eat bunnies.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010054.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just have chicken seems to be strange, </p>
  <p>so I stopped by the restaurant I went to this morning and bought some vegetable buns to go with the chicken. </p>
  <p>Vegetable and meat buns are the same price, 0.4 RMB.  But obviously the vegetable ones are much bigger.</p>
  <p>One tray of steamer can fit 10 meat buns and still has plenty of space left.  But it can only fit 7 vegetable buns.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010055.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Back to the hotel and enjoyed my lunch and then took a nap.  I could have a leisure afternoon….</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Woke up at 2:00, took a bottle of Pepsi and got on bus number 58.  </p>
  <p>Bus fare for one-way is 1.5 RMB.  We headed toward the White Horse Temple. </p>
  <p>Louyand buses announce the stop name after arriving at each stop so it is very difficult to get lost.</p>
  <p>You can pay cash or use something similar to metro cards.  Who says China is falling behind?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010058.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The bus ride was about half hour.  </p>
  <p>Along the temple were all vendors and their signs were all consistent with blank background and yellow characters. </p>
  <p>Even though there were a lot of vendors, but every thing were well organized.</p>
  <p>Also surprisingly, there were many trash cans and cleaning crews.  </p>
  <p>It was very clean and it made people to fall in love with it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010061.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I bought a ticket for 35 RMB. And bikes are not allowed here.  Luckily I took a bus….Whew………</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010066.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I was at outside, I saw a lot of tourists.  After went inside and there were even more.</p>
  <p>The White Horse Temple is the first Buddhist temple built in China.  </p>
  <p>For devoted Buddhist believers here would be considered a holy place they have to visit at least once in their lifetime.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010083.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were so many incenses burning that they were burning in flame.</p>
  <p>The whole combustible base was filled with burning incenses.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010141.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If you have enough people in a group, you can ask one of the masters from the temple to give you a tour. </p>
  <p>Because I was by myself, so I just blended right into other people’s group and listened to the stories about the White Horse Temple.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010073.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A long time ago, some one dreamed of a ramble of thunders or something like that.  </p>
  <p>He took it as a sign and walked toward the west.</p>
  <p> He ran into two monks from Indian at Afghanistan, so he invited them to China to preach and translate Buddhist text.</p>
  <p>People built this temple for these two monks.  </p>
  <p>Because the Buddhist text was carried by a white horse, they named this temple after the white horse.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010134.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This story might sound boring at the beginning.  </p>
  <p>But this event took place in East Han Dynasty (25 AD to 220 AD), five or six hundred years prior to Xuanzang. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010101.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The master who was giving us a tour is named Miaotian (same name as the con artist in Taiwan)</p>
  <p>He was first trained in Shaolin Monastery.  He then went to Xiangguo Temple and now stays at White Horse Temple.</p>
  <p>There are over a hundred monks in the White Horse Temple learning Buddhism </p>
  <p>and hoping one day they will relieve the suffering in reincarnation.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010149.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The master asked me where I am from.  </p>
  <p>This is the first time I told the truth that I am from Taiwan.</p>
  <p>After found out that I am traveling by bike, he asked where I was staying.  </p>
  <p>This is because he can help me to find a spot to stay in White Horse Temp.  And for FREE …. : )</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, I have to leave Louyang tomorrow.  </p>
  <p>Otherwise, I could have an opportunity to stay overnight at the White Horse Temple.  </p>
  <p>Waking up early in the morning, attending morning session with the masters,  </p>
  <p>saying the prayers and then hitting the bell and drum at the bell tower for 108 times, which represents elimination of 108 temptations.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010172.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The White Hoarse Temple is not just a single architecture structure.  </p>
  <p>After several renovations and expansions, there are several halls, including Mahavira Hall, Main Hall, Hall of Great Buddha…, etc.</p>
  <p>Today, Mahavira Hall worships Buddha statues that were made by the lost of ancient technique.</p>
  <p>Because they are very precious national treasures, lights are not allowed inside and not opened to public.</p>
  <p> Visitors can only observe from outside.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The master said that Gautama Buddha always brought Ananda, one of his disciples, to his sermons. </p>
  <p>Why Ananda?</p>
  <p>Because Ananda had a very good memory and he could remember every word the Gautama Buddha said at his sermons.  </p>
  <p>A lot of text we read today was written by him.  We should thank him for his good memory.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The legend said that when the Gautama Buddha was teaching at his sermons, he would also bring along 2 fairies.  </p>
  <p>When he talked about something very interesting, these two fairies would fly up into the sky and spread flower petals.  </p>
  <p>This is where the phrase “flying goddess spread flowers” came from.</p>
  <p>I don’t know why, but when I heard the story, it reminded me of Aju and Ahua </p>
  <p>(two of background singers and dancers of a famous Taiwanese singer)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Listened to the master explaining the temple to us, everything was so new to me and they were very interesting.  </p>
  <p>Sitting under the rooftop of the temple and drinking free hot tea, it almost made me feel that I want to become a monk.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010158.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Along the temple are two tombs.  There several thousands years old sacred relics from monks inside the tombs.  </p>
  <p>I wondered if they were from the two Indian monks that were stopped at Afghanistan. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010182.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are many bamboos and fragrant irises planted around the tombs.  Very beautiful ~</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010174.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After spending two hours here, I am still not getting enough.  </p>
  <p>35 RMB for a ticket is definitely worth it.  People who are interested in Buddhism should be very touched if they are here.</p>
  <p>I saw several older female visitors were kowdowing from the first statue of Guan Yin to the last statue of Gautama Buddha</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Back to downtown, dinner was the vegetarian duns bought at the lunch time.  One day in Louyang ended too quickly.</p>
  <p>Tomorrow, I will continue head toward Xi’an.  If everything goes well, I should be there in two to three days.</p>
