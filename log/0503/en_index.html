  <p class="style5">The Happiness from 5 cents</p>
  <p>While I was leaving Luoyang city, a guy in his seventies who was on his bike to work, asked me where I was headed to today. </p>
  <p>He said that he had biked from here to Xian, it was all uphill pedaling, very tough.</p>
  <p> &quot;No problem!  &quot;Whatever goes up must come down&quot;, I will be having a great time when I bike downhill then&quot;, I replied. </p>
  <p>He smiled at me, and wished me luck.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I finally realized his mysterious smile--- at the end of the day.  </p>
  <p>I was definitely right about &quot;whatever goes up must come down&quot;. </p>
  <p>The only problem was, most of the time, TODAY, I was pedaling UP. </p>
  <p>Overall, the route was about 4/5 uphill and 1/5 downhill.  I was so exhausted.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had to put on my face mask, which was part of my Desert Gear, today. </p>
  <p>I decided that I have had enough of the dust raised from those crazy trucks and tractors for the past coupe of days. </p>
  <p>Not to mention the nasty gnats flying into my nose to volunteer becoming part of the yucky mucus these days. </p>
  <p>I just had to protect my face and my nose, RIGHT NOW.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is what I look like: with my head wrap, sunglasses, and face mask.  </p>
  <p>Bet I can drag quite an attention if I show up like this in the bank???</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010189.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Like I said at the very beginning, it was an &quot;uphill day&quot;. </p>
  <p>Whole day long, endlessly, I was climbing UP, UP, and UP, just like riding on the famous Suao Hualien Highway in Taiwan.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010207.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Uphill has no sympathy to the people biking on it.  I had to take care myself, I had to find FOOD. </p>
  <p>All I had left at this time was two jins (1 Jin is approximately 1.1 pound) of the &quot;brick&quot; biscuits, I need more. </p>
  <p>As soon as I entered this grocery store, I gulped up 600 ml of  milk.  </p>
  <p>I also bought one jin of suncake-like biscuits (8 of them), and a bag of candy for my snack. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Interestingly, I have noticed that everything in this store was covered with a layer of dust, </p>
  <p>I wondered that was because of the windy situation in this area or---nobody ever came to this store??? </p>
  <p>Well, I know I will not trust the expiration date label—IF there is one, anyway. </p>
  <p>I am sure everything here has an expiration date of 100 years, I will take my chances.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010213.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Eating the yummy suncake and riding on my bike, I continued the endless &quot;moving up&quot; adventure. </p>
  <p>I don't mind the climbing that much anymore, but I really can't take the stinky smell filled in the air when I was passing somewhere. </p>
  <p>What was THAT??? It didn't smell like any of the fertilizer for those crops.  Maybe decomposition of some sort? </p>
  <p>It was really disgusting.  Even with my mask on, I had to hold my breath and pedaled as fast as I can. </p>
  <p>After a while, I inhaled a tiny little bit of the air to make sure that stinky smell had gone, then I finally got to breath normally.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After finishing my fried rice lunch at Yima, I sat outside of that restaurant, having some tea and keeping my Dido company. </p>
  <p>A little kid, who looked like 5-6 years old, came to stare at me.  </p>
  <p>I offered some candy to him, but he just ran away after I asked several times. </p>
  <p>He probably thought I was a weirdo?  A couple of minutes later, the kid came back on his own tricycle, showing me &quot;See what I have?&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>3:00 pm. A local gas station. Enjoy my popsicle.</p>
  <p>It was just an ordinary popsicle, just made of water and sugar, but… man.. How can it be so delicious?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010198.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While I was enjoy my popsicle, the family worked in the gas station decided to have some conversation with me. </p>
  <p>&quot;Do you mind some company on the way to Urumuqi?&quot; the Dad asked. </p>
  <p>&quot;It is not a good idea, because I got lost very often.&quot; I replied. </p>
  <p>For some reason, the father interpreted my reply as a &quot;YES&quot;. </p>
  <p>So he asked his two sons to get the bikes out, and told them to take on adventure with me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>WAIT A MINUTE!!!  NO KIDDING!!! I just stopped by to have some popsicless, please don't reward me with two little kids.</p>
  <p>It was such a blast to sit in the shade and eating popsicles, compared to mountain biking under the sun, I was totally in heaven. </p>
  <p>To extend my &quot;happy hour&quot;, literally, I finished totally 4 popsicles, one after another.  Then, well, time to go.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>How interesting!  I saw many doors IN the mountain. I wondered how they did that. </p>
  <p>Did they really dig into the mountain and live there?Wish I can tour some of them somehow someday.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010212.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am guessing the humidity is really low, I didn't sweat much at all during the past couple of days, and it was quite comfortable. </p>
  <p>However, my knees felt the opposite.  Finally, after almost 100 km of uphill, </p>
  <p>the road turned to mostly downhill right before I approached Sanmenxia.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Just when I was leaving the mountainous area, a white van slowed down and waited for me. </p>
  <p>A young guy asked me some typical questions like &quot;Where are you from?&quot;, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; etc. </p>
  <p>Afterwards, unbelievably, he gave me a cold beer. </p>
  <p>Wow!  The very first time that somebody rooted for me AND gave me a beer. What a treat!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br />
    I thanked and waved them goodbye, still overwhelming what just happened. </p>
  <p>Then, &quot;I should've asked if they have soda instead&quot;, I thought.  I gulped the beer.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The first sign I saw after entering Sanmenxia was on a HOTEL.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010224.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I went in to check the rate immediately. The owner said &quot;30 RMB&quot;, I thanked him and left. </p>
  <p>He grabbed me back and dropped the price to 20 RMB. </p>
  <p>I didn't like his attitude at all, but my legs were really sore from the &quot;mountain biking&quot; today. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010222.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Well, at least it was a clean room, with water to wash my clothes, outlet to plug in my gears, not too bad, really.</p>
  <p>I was hoping to taste some local delight tonight, but obviously there was none. </p>
  <p>So I fed my empty stomach with some pork/pickled mustard noodle soup at the next door.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I remembered the guy at the gas station saying I would be finishing half of my tour by the time I entered Xian—IF my destination was Urumuqi. </p>
  <p>For real, from Beijing to Xian, is hardly 1/3 or even ¼ of my total trip planned in China. Still have a long way to go.</p>
  <p>This hotel was facing the train station; </p>
  <p>I can hear every single word from the PA system announcing the time and destination of each train. </p>
  <p>It was non-stopping from 9:00 pm to mid-night; this station was really that busy?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Probably for the same reason, people checked in almost every hour after mid-night, </p>
  <p>and I was woken up every single time by the noise they were making. </p>
  <p>I stared at my watch and wondered how much time did I have left to sleep ZZZZZ</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Thinking of those scrumptious sugar popsicles I had today, I can't believe how happy I was from just five cents!</p>
