  <p> “KEEP OUT, IT IS TAKEN”</p>
  <p>When I was pooping in the public restroom in the early morning, I heard footstep outside.</p>
  <p>Even I had made myself loud and clear; the person still took a peek inside the restroom.</p>
  <p>“That’s alright, I am a man was well” said the man</p>
  <p>He walked in, took off his pants, and took a dump, right in front of me.</p>
  <p>We were only divided by a 50 centimeter high mini wall.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even it was expected, I still could not handle it.</p>
  <p>Well, let’s do it together then.</p>
  <p>I covered my mouth and nose with a towel.</p>
  <p>The man did not mind shitting together, and insisted on chatting me up.</p>
  <p>He asked if I knew the distance between here and a city in ShaanXi province.</p>
  <p>I said “I don’t know, I am not a local”, and stopped the conversation promptly.</p>
  <p>That man started to talk about an interview in that city, looking for work, and needing help for job arrangement… </p>
  <p>I did not talk when I pooped, maybe read animated magazines.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even frightened, I still had a good poop to make me feel 100%</p>
  <p><br />
    Paid two dollars RMB for my breakfast, deep-fried Chinese doughnuts and soy milk</p>
  <p> (BTW, the doughnuts were small and the soymilk was diluted with water for my taste).</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010227.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Usually three doughnuts cost 50 cents RMB and soy milk cost 50 cents RMB, I did not haggle with the store owner though.</p>
  <p>However, I started to care about such small money just ten days after I arrived in China.</p>
  <p>I changed my attitude, probably because my favorite ice pop costs me 50 cents, and 50 cents became a norm price.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The breakfast did not keep me feeling full; I bought five red bean buns, five for 30 cents, as my snacks before set off.</p>
  <p><br />
    Continued with climbing up and down, but the situation was better than yesterday, more down hills.</p>
  <p>Generally speaking, it was an easy climb up. </p>
  <p>The distance between SanMenXia and XiAn was 260 KM, I probably had to make it a two-day trip. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010232.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> The mileage signs here were ridiculous; sometimes the discrepancy in distance could be more than 10 KM.</p>
  <p>The mileage signs indicated that I had advanced 30 KM, </p>
  <p>but the truth was I just rode 100 meters or the name of the same road </p>
  <p>shown on the sign changed back and forth between Route 206 and Route 310.</p>
  <p>Route 310 could take me all the way to ShaanXi provice, </p>
  <p>if I made it to ShaanXi province; half of the trip from SanXiaMen to XiAn would be finished.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010252.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Kept climbing up and down in mountains, one hilltop followed by another hilltop, hilly, hilly, but hilly</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lunched at a nice restaurant where I could take a break and hide from the sun; </p>
  <p>the one hour lunch break was precious to me.</p>
  <p>Vigorous exercise increased appetite. Just finished the five red bean buns on the way not long ago, </p>
  <p>when the fry pork chop noodle was served, I ate it up.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010241.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Some places had map boards, however, the maps were badly drawn, and nobody could read them</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010269.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>My newly developed fun is looking for roadside fruit stands selling pineapples at small villages.</p>
  <p>In addition to fruit stands, I also looked forward to roadside kiosks.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>China was so overpopulated; it seemed that human replaced machines.</p>
  <p>The roadside kiosks were operated by old women, nothing fancy about them but a beach umbrella and a white refrigerator.</p>
  <p>The roadside kiosks carried beverages and cigarettes.</p>
  <p>I did not buy from them except I was out of water or exhausted, because the beverages were overpriced.</p>
  <p>Since I found out the kiosks carried ice pops; I always stopped by and ask for white sugar ice pops.</p>
  <p>If they had them in stock, I would buy one, holding it in my mouth and enjoying the cold sensation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A method how not to get lost was developed along the way; therefore, it was not necessarily to read maps or road signs.</p>
  <p>Following commuter bus as simple as it gets.</p>
  <p>Fully loaded commuter buses ran between cities. When they passed by, I always carefully read the bus route on the windshield.</p>
  <p>If the bus headed toward my destination, I was surely on the right track, kept going!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010267.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I was struggling up a uphill in the hot afternoon sun, </p>
  <p>I spotted an old man at his sixty pulling a heavy loaded two-wheel cart. The cart was filled up with bottles for recycle.</p>
  <p>An old woman behind the cart was pushing it to help the pulling.</p>
  <p>They paired up to move the cart up to the steep slope just like me.</p>
  <p>All of sudden, I was grateful for what I had got and who I were, no more complain!  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010270.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I felt like to stop and help them out; however, it was just a thought.</p>
  <p>I had to fulfill my goal, B2P/Bike to protect our Planet</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010260.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Route 310 ran from HeNan province to ShaanXi province, I saw no province border sign along the way, but biked mindlessly. </p>
  <p>Shouldn’t I have entered ShaanXi province?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Rode into a bustling town after a hilltop</p>
  <p>Ma’ma, where am I? HeNan or ShaanXi” I asked</p>
  <p><br />
    I was not aware that I had arrived ShaanXi and done for the day! </p>
  <p>Happily found a cheap hostel, 10 dollars RMB for one night, the room was even better than the 20 dollar room I had yesterday.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010283.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Washed clothes before sunset, I had to wear the same clothes tomorrow</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010280.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Dinner was at “Xhue Family Original” run by a three generation family,  </p>
  <p>the family got the same last name as mine, Xhue. I felt good to support the restaurant.</p>
  <p>My dinner included noodle, spicy bean sprout salad, and “BaoMo”. </p>
  <p>It seemed nice to have salad on the hot summer night, wow! the salad was a bit spicy</p>
  <p>BaoMo was baked bun stuffed with braised meat.</p>
  <p><br />
    I got into this bustling city just by crossing a hill, who would knew what was waiting for me next?<br />
