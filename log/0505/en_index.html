  <p class="style5">Warm Up is Over</p>
  <p>The road leaving Tongguan was so terrible that it made me wanted to cry.  </p>
  <p>Filled with broken down gravels and dirt, it was a torture whether it was going up hill or down hill.</p>
  <p>A few kilometers later, the challenge of up hill climbing was finally over.  </p>
  <p>The road became nice and smooth and it was much easier on my feet.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010287.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Next, all I saw was Mount Hua mountain ridge.   </p>
  <p>Tourist hotels were everywhere with non-stop tour buses coming and going.  </p>
  <p>Mount Hua was really beautiful looking from the mountain foot.</p>
  <p>I don’t know what I would see when I climb up to the top of hill.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010295.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010298.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The distance I had to ride today is not shorter than yesterday.  </p>
  <p>But without going up and down the hills, it is definitely easier to accomplish.</p>
  <p>Except, here is the problem.  Since I am riding westbound, the sun is in my face after 2 or 3 o’clock in the afternoon.</p>
  <p>Even when I have UV400 extra strength sunglasses on, I can barely keep my eyes open for a few hours until the end of day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I finished all my dry goods, except the brick flatbread.  </p>
  <p>Every time when I eat one of these brick flatbread, my stomach would complaint.  So I am saving them for emergency only.</p>
  <p>After 9 o’clock in the morning, I saw a restaurant with white smoke.  </p>
  <p>The boss lady asked me what I want.  </p>
  <p>Looking at the long list of menu and then I saw a kid having rice noodle and it looked delicious. So I ordered the same.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010306.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And it was a right decision.  It tasted really good.  </p>
  <p>It had a firm texture of rice noodle with broth, shredded seaweed, dried shrimp and top with cilantro.  Excellent! </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010303.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because of the strong sunray, it made me want to buy a floral sun hat.</p>
  <p>When I get to Xi’an, I must go shopping and find me a suitable sun hat.</p>
  <p>Otherwise, I will become a dried squid by the time I get to Urumchi</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A big red watermelon cost 2 RMB for 1 kilogram.  </p>
  <p>I asked the owner to cut 4 kilograms of melon and enjoyed the melon while avoiding the heat.</p>
  <p>I told the owner that I am from Beijing.  </p>
  <p>Not after a couple of sentences, the owner questioned, “You are not from Beijing!”</p>
  <p>What? How do you know?  Is my accent ready that bad?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010312.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had stir-fried noodle for lunch at a small restaurant.  </p>
  <p>The owner asked me what kind of noodle I want. Thin noodle or pulled noodle?</p>
  <p>Without a doubt, pulled noodle please because it looked delicious.</p>
  <p>But I waited for half hour for a dish of stir-fried pulled noodle.</p>
  <p><br />
    I watched the owner kneeling the dough, cutting the dough into strips of 2 centimeters thick, </p>
  <p>and then pulling them by hand one by one until they were as thick as a noodle.</p>
  <p>He was really pulling one by one and then holding them in his hands and pulled.  </p>
  <p>And then, BAM! Slapped them on the table for the final touch. </p>
  <p>Now you have one order of hand “pulled” noodle. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Wow…I though pulled noodle was made by cutting the dough with knifes, not pulling one by one by hand.</p>
  <p>The order that was just finished wasn’t even mine; it was someone else who has ordered before me.  </p>
  <p>I still had to wait for mine.</p>
  <p>Every one of those orders was freshly made when the order was placed, so I waited for a long long time for my noodle.</p>
  <p>Before the boss lady prepared my noodle, she asked me if I wanted it spicy and I said NO.  </p>
  <p>But she still cooked with red hot oil.</p>
  <p>So of course, it was very spicy.  My tong lost feelings after just two bites.  </p>
  <p>Finally I finished the entire noodle by drinking a lot of tea. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010316.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The sun was very strong and there were no shade for me to hide.  </p>
  <p>Once in a while I could hide under an overpass.</p>
  <p>Looked at the blazing sun, it was only beginning of May and the temperature was already this hot.  </p>
  <p>I don’t know what would happen if I began my trip later.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010319.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The reason that I have been buying sugar popsicles was I thought these popsicles were only 0.50 RMB because they were sugar flavor.  </p>
  <p>That’s why they were cheap.  Oh, was I wrong.</p>
  <p>All flavored are 0.50 RBM, not just sugar flavor.  </p>
  <p>After I discovered this secret, I had 8 popsicles today.  </p>
  <p>They were sugar, cantaloupe, red bean, green bean, milk and strawberries flavor. </p>
  <p>All 0.50 RBM each!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding bike facing west, when I almost arrived at Xi’an, the road all the sudden became terrible.  </p>
  <p>After several of turns, finally I arrived at the super huge city – Xi’an.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010324.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Xi’an might be even bigger than Beijing.</p>
  <p>It is really huge.  It might be as big as Taipei and all the surrounding cities, which is the northern Taiwan.  </p>
  <p>But this is just a city.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even though the city is big and beautiful, the roads are very well structured, but the prices are suddenly went up sky high.</p>
  <p>I checked a few “guest houses” along the way and there were over 100 RMB per night.  </p>
  <p>What?  That’s ridiculous!</p>
  <p>And when the staff told me the price, obviously they were thinking, </p>
  <p>“Why do you even bother to ask the price? You can’t afford it!”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Don’t you dare to look down at me like that!  I really want to throw hundred dollar bills at her face.  </p>
  <p>But I shouldn’t waste money like that, so I continued to look for cheaper hotels.</p>
  <p>Continued checking prices and moved toward the direction of the train station.</p>
  <p>This is because in the next couple of days, I will take buses near the train station for sightseeing.</p>
  <p>The closer I get to the train station, the more convenience it will be.</p>
  <p>There are many hotels here, so I have to hurry up and check as many hotels as possible to find one that is in my budget.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Found one with 40 RMB per night.  It was a little expensive so I negotiated with the owner.</p>
  <p>If I stayed for 3 nights, can I get a discount?</p>
  <p>The owner said that they are almost booked so it is hard to give me a discount.</p>
  <p>After negotiation, finally we agreed on 30 RMB per night for 3 nights. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010327.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After seen the room, I understood why it was 40 RMB.  This was a nice double bed room.</p>
  <p>It looks like I will have a good night sleep for the next three days….</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Tonight’s dinner was very casual.  It was a couple of envelopes of Milo chocolate with brick flatbread broken into small pieces </p>
  <p>and then mixed with hot water provided by the hotel, now I had home-made chocolate oatmeal.  </p>
  <p>After brick flatbread became nice of soft, finally I could eat it without getting upset stomach and it was very filling, too. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It took me 13 days to get to Xi’an from Beijing.</p>
  <p>From Beijing to Xi’an was my B2P warm up trip.  The real challenge will start from Xi’an.</p>
  <p>Now the warm up is over.  The condition of equipment and Dido are very good.  </p>
  <p>My body is healthy.  The extent of warm up is just right.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had a late night snack.  The streets are still very busy at 10, 11 o’clock at night.  Not like a ghost town at all.</p>
  <p>I found a restaurant selling the “must try” lamb Bao Mo.</p>
  <p>That was expensive!  12 RMB for one bowl.  If it was with beef, then it was 9 RMB.</p>
  <p>It was bun cut into very small pieces, mixed with very hot broth and top with slides of lamb.  It also has cellophane noodle in the bowl. </p>
  <p>Garnished with hot pepper sauce and vinegar pickled garlic which were perfect with lamb.</p>
  <p>After soaking with broth, bao mo tasted very good.</p>
  <p>I would recommend this dish, except it was expensive.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Tomorrow after waking up, I will visit terracotta solders.  I was very excited and looking forward to it. </p>
  <p>I asked the hotel owner for the direction.  From where I stayed to the train station will only take 10 minutes by foot.</p>
  <p>I can just take a bus.  But the ticket for terracotta solders is very expensive.  90 RMB per ticket.</p>
  <p>Plus other places, such as Qin Emperor’s Tomb.  Hmmmm….how much money should I bring?</p>
