  <p class="style5">First Emperor’s Clay Army</p>
  <p>I woke up around 6:30AM.</p>
  <p>Today’s plan was to visit Emperor Qin’s Terra-Cotta Warriors and Horses Museum.</p>
  <p> I traveled light and only carried my camera and a notebook to go with me.</p>
  <p>The hostel I stayed was in a convenient location, only 10 minutes walk to the train station.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010477.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were many public buses and tour buses leaving from the train station.</p>
  <p> It should be no problem finding a bus going to anywhere in Xian. </p>
  <p>I was afraid that the bus did not give small change, so I spent one RMB for breakfast to get some change.</p>
  <p>Wandering in front of the train station, very soon I found the double-deck bus </p>
  <p>which operated along the highway to the Terra-cotta Warriors and Horses Museum </p>
  <p>(some buses drove along local roads not only to pick up more passengers, but also to avoid the toll). </p>
  <p>It cost me 7RMB each way, a reasonable price.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010335.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were many taxis soliciting tourists in front of the train station. </p>
  <p>Taxi drivers kept asking “Where do you want to go? </p>
  <p>Huaqing Hot Springs, Terra-cotta Warriors and Horses Museum? Emperor Qin’s Mausoleum?”. </p>
  <p>Out of curiosity, I spoke to a taxi driver for the price to go to the Terra-cotta Warrior and Horses Museum.</p>
  <p>The starting price for the flat rate was one hundred RMB. </p>
  <p>If running on taxi-meter, it was 1.2 RMB per km. Taxis in China are not cheap.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010336.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> China’s Chinese-English translation was very “cool”. </p>
  <p>“Public Bus” could be translated to “Gong Jiao Ba Shi”.</p>
  <p>Translation like such was for whom? For foreigners?</p>
  <p>I was sure that foreigners won’t understand it at all. For Chinese? </p>
  <p>Chinese would only just read the Chinese. </p>
  <p>It must be for the kids who do not read Chinese but have learned Hanyu Pingyin.</p>
  <p>[Note: “Gong Jiao Ba Shi” is the phonetic translation of Chinese “public bus”]</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There were backpackers from different countries in front of the train station. </p>
  <p>They all carried tour books and maps in their own languages for information.</p>
  <p>I really like the concept of the self-guided tour and always travel on my own. </p>
  <p>I would never ever join a guided tour unless it was free.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On the way to the Museum, the bus passed Huaqing Hot Springs</p>
  <p> (I was not interested in the place where Yang Guifei took a bath, so I did not get off the bus).</p>
  <p>Then, the bus passed Emperor Qinshihuang’s mausoleum, which was an earthen mound.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010342.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The mercury density around the tomb is higher than other areas, </p>
  <p>about 250 times higher than the safety standard. </p>
  <p>The mercury vapor trapped inside the tomb is highly toxic. As of now, </p>
  <p>nine passages dug by tomb robbers have been found, but all the tomb robbers died of poison.</p>
  <p>Moreover, within the tomb, traps and weapons were installed to deter tomb robbers. </p>
  <p>The tomb was very deep, according to historical records, </p>
  <p>the man in charge of the construction reported to the emperor that they could not dig in any more, since they could not light their torch. </p>
  <p>Nobody knows how deep it would have to be to prevent a torch from igniting.</p>
  <p>Historical documents said that 720,000 laborers were forced to construct the tomb, </p>
  <p>but it is still unknown how huge the mausoleum could be.</p>
  <p>The excavation of the tomb is ruled out because there is no good technology for protecting the relics inside the tomb. </p>
  <p>I just imagined what it might look like but did not get off the bus.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The last bus stop was the Terra-cotta Warrior and Horses Museum. </p>
  <p>There is about half an hour walk from where I got off to the ticket booth. </p>
  <p>Of course, along the way, there were many gift shops selling terra-cotta army replicas.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010362.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010352.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>You can find restaurants, gift shops and hotels in one of the museum facilities, “Terra-cotta Warrior Village”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010455.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The admission fee was 90 RMB for an adult, and the ticket was like a credit card.</p>
  <p> Everybody was screened by the walk-through metal detector before entering the museum.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010369.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The terra-cotta army was discovered in 1974 when a local farmer accidentally found some pottery fragments. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010355.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Now, this farmer makes a living selling his autograph at the “Terra-cotta Warrior Village”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>No one knows why the terra-cotta army became buried and lost from memory, </p>
  <p>and no written records of the Terracotta Warriors have been found. </p>
  <p>Many unknowns can only be guessed at by archeologists’ observation and research.</p>
  <p>In a nut shell, Emperor Qinshihuang wanted a long life and feared that </p>
  <p>his empire would collapse after he died. So, he built himself a huge tomb.</p>
  <p><br />
    Because he wanted to lead his army to protect his mausoleum and perpetuate his rule, </p>
  <p>he built the terra-cotta army. The army was consisted of foot soldiers,</p>
  <p> cavalrymen, civil officers, military officers, chariots, weapons, and many more.</p>
  <p><br />
  At the last years of Qing dynasty, when a rebel army attacked Xianyang, they found the terra-cotta army. </p>
  <p>They removed their weapons, smashed the clay soldiers, and set the tomb ablaze.</p>
  <p>The rebels must have laughed at this terra-cotta army who were weak, and could not stand up to any attack.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010380.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>2,280 years later, the terra-cotta army was unearthed accidentally again.</p>
  <p>Many archaeologists came to join in the excavation of the unrecorded archaeological wonder.</p>
  <p>The museum has three exhibition halls, Pit 1, Pit 2 and Pit 3.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Pit 1 was the first to be discovered and excavated. </p>
  <p>The clay soldiers in Pit 1 faced east. However, the soldiers’ weapons had been stolen. </p>
  <p>What had left in Pit 1 were smashed and burned pottery fragments.</p>
  <p>Mending broken soldiers and removing the dirt from the sculptures bit by bit makes it very difficult to restore the clay soldiers. </p>
  <p>It takes a professional several months of painstaking work to restore one clay soldier.</p>
  <p>It took eight years of restoration from the time the two bronze chariots and horses were discovered, </p>
  <p>to the time they were finally put up on display.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010398.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Restoration of the clay soldiers is the ultimate challenge of reassembling 3D jigsaw puzzles. </p>
  <p>The archaeologists with the Terra-cotta Warriors and Horses Museum did it, </p>
  <p>so we are able to see the restored terra-cotta warriors and horses.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010407.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The warriors always appeared as having a dull dirt color but they were originally painted brilliant colors. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010442.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>TThe figures had lost their color during their two thousand years underground due to natural erosion and aging. </p>
  <p>Once a figure with the colors intact was excavated, the paint quickly peel off after being re-exposed to the air, </p>
  <p>daylight and the sudden change in temperature and humidity. </p>
  <p>Today’s technology is not able to preserve the color and restore the figures back to their original condition.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010402.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I admired that the China officials made the decision to do </p>
  <p>no further excavation of Pit 1. Pit 2 has been filled in and remains almost intact.</p>
  <p>Let the 6,000 warriors and houses remain buried underground. </p>
  <p>Even they are unearthed now, they are not able to be restored and preserved, which would only accelerates the damage.</p>
  <p>Let’s wait until the day that human technology can fully restore the terra-cotta warriors and horses, </p>
  <p>then the excavation could be resumed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010411.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If you have a chance to come to visit the Museum, don’t skimp on your tour, </p>
  <p>please hire a tour guide at the museum entrance. </p>
  <p>It is really inexpensive, 30 RMB for a group of five or less, or 40 RMB for a group of 10 or less, </p>
  <p>and each tour is about one to two hours. The professional tour guides are very knowledgeable </p>
  <p>and would definitely make your tour a memorable and worthwhile experience. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I did not have money for a tour guide but listened in on other tours.</p>
  <p>I spent five hours at the Museum and learned quite a lot. It was a very worthwhile trip to Xian.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010440.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> Pit 2 was tentatively excavated in a few areas. Based on the excavation, </p>
  <p>the archaeologists estimated the military formation of Pit 2. </p>
  <p>The formation was mixed with various kinds of soldiers. Most of the soldiers in Pit 1 were foot soldiers.</p>
  <p>In order to protect the unearthed treasure, Pit 2 is lit with very dim light and the room temperature is set low (Pit 1 is very bright). </p>
  <p>The museum does its best to preserve the artifacts.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Pit 3 is the headquarters for the army but it is very small (probably not bigger than our houses) </p>
  <p>which is divided into two side rooms,north and south. </p>
  <p>While the military officials were meeting inside the headquarters, the solders stood guard outside.</p>
  <p>The restored clay soldiers are displayed in the south room, </p>
  <p>and the clay soldiers in the north room remain as they were when they were unearthed. </p>
  <p>After seeing both restored and un-restored figures, I am amazed by the restoration success.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010461.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The life-sized terra-cotta warriors and horses are regarded as </p>
  <p>“the eighth wonder of the world” in terms of scale, size and artistic quality.</p>
  <p>Each life-size figure was sculptured individually, and each has expression, body build and posture of its own. </p>
  <p>For the clothes, they were made based on Qin Dynasty’s fashion. </p>
  <p>From the belt style, hair style to shoe laces, everything was made as lifelike as possible.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010433.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The crafting technique is unbelievably superb in its details. </p>
  <p>Even the soles were carved with a tread pattern to resemble the real anti-slip shoes.</p>
  <p>The hair for the soldiers was also carefully styled and detailed.</p>
  <p>The making of the terra-cotta warriors is not only a large artistic production, the clay soldiers are also masterpieces of realism.</p>
  <p>As for weapons, besides the stolen majority, there were some discovered among the remains.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A bronze sword found under a 300 kg clay soldier was bent by the weigh but not broken.</p>
  <p>When the excavators lifted up the clay soldier, the bent sword sprang back into shape in a few minutes.</p>
  <p>Bronze rusts easily, and turns black-green.</p>
  <p>However, this 2,000-year-old bronze sword still shines with a sharp blade. </p>
  <p>It is still elastic and can cut through a deck of thirty newspapers. This is a miracle in the history of metallurgy.</p>
  <p><br />
    </p>
  <p>The antirust method was developed by the West in 1930.</p>
  <p>However, two thousand years ago, the Qin dynasty had developed the technique to prevent rust. </p>
  <p>What an incredible civilization! It is a pity that the technique had been lost over time. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Hee Hee, I learned all this from tour guides of other groups, I was not that knowledgeable myself.</p>
  <p>Tour Guide Promotion: I followed at least fifteen tour guides today </p>
  <p>(it would be too obvious if I eavesdropped only one particular guide), </p>
  <p>every guide was very professional. If you have a chance to come to visit the Museum, </p>
  <p>don’t skimp on your tour, please hire a tour guide at the museum entrance. </p>
  <p><br />
    There were other small stories, such as, all the clay soldiers were single eyelids. </p>
  <p>It was not because the double eyelids were harder to make, </p>
  <p>it was because the Qin Dynasty thought double eyelids made men look sissy.</p>
  <p> A handsome man should have a single eyelid. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the past, you could pay ten cents RMB to walk down to the pit and touch the clay soldiers. </p>
  <p>After a clay solder’s head was stolen by a person who paid for the service, </p>
  <p>the service was cancelled. The head was sold for 320,000 USD on the black market.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The army of QinShihuang was more than a million strong. </p>
  <p>Those made into terra-cotta warriors must have been the ones </p>
  <p>who defeated all the other warring states and helped QinShihuang unify the Qin Empire.</p>
  <p>Therefore, these eight thousand soldiers were recreated in clay to protect QinShihuang’s tomb for eternity.</p>
  <p>If each terra-cotta warrior was really modeled after a real soldier, </p>
  <p>can I deduce that soldiers posed for the craftsmen to sculpture their clay soldiers, </p>
  <p>and then the clay soldiers were fired and painted?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I imagined that the soldier told the craftsman </p>
  <p>“Hey, make me a single eyelid soldier, I will look more handsome that way”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010437.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I forgot to bring my own water and ate only three fried cakes for breakfast, </p>
  <p>so I was hungry and thirty after five hours in the museum.</p>
  <p>However, the food and beverage sold in the museum restaurant were expensive. </p>
  <p>They were priced three times higher than the market price.</p>
  <p>For foreigners, they probably would think it was inexpensive, no big deal. </p>
  <p>However, I was currently in a “poor” state and had to be frugal. </p>
  <p>(Probably because its fame and the high entrance fee, almost half of the visitors are from overseas)</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010371.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A two RMB soda was sold for eight RMB in the museum.</p>
  <p>The museum restaurant is mainly for tour groups for big feasts. Less common popcorn was ten RMB for one bucket. </p>
  <p>Sigh! I just had to live with my hunger till I was back in Xian.</p>
  <p>In Universal Studio Japan, I spent three hundred NT for popcorn and felt nothing. Now, forty-NT popcorn became a luxury.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I went back to Xian by bus. I had my dinner in a Sichuan restaurant, ordered beef noodle. </p>
  <p>(wait a minute! the beef noodle had no beef in it, what kind of beef noodle it is?)</p>
  <p>I also had very tasty intestine clay pot (it tasted like SanMa stinky pot). At last, I could enjoy my kind of lunch!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010472.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> After lunch, I bought two instant noodles, one bag of Want Want rice crackers, </p>
  <p>and one 50-cent ice pop at a convenience store. The total was only seven RMB.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I walked back to my hostel from the Internet café. On the way, I bought five bags of milk from a dairy. </p>
  <p>I was about to buy two bags, two and twenty cents RMB for two bags of milk. </p>
  <p>I thought the smallest change was fifty cents RMB. How did I pay twenty cents RMB? </p>
  <p>It turned out there was ten-cent RMB bill. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Unbelievable! China does not use coins but only paper money. </p>
  <p>Because it is inexpensive to live there, a one RMB bill can buy you five buns.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had been in China for two weeks, and never had a chance to use 10 cent bills.  </p>
  <p>Three 10 cents bills were useless. In order to round it up, I bought five bags of milk. </p>
  <p>My dinner would be three bags of milk with the Want Want rice crackers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By the way, the Want Want Food Company is working hard in China. Their TV commercials are aired frequently.</p>
  <p>However, its TV ads such as “O Pao Fruit Milk” are stupid, and worse than the dumb teletubbies.</p>
  <p>For tomorrow, I planned to wander around Xian on my bike. Maybe I would pay a visit to Xianyang.</p>
  <p>That is because I would leave Xian to take Route 310, and would not pass by Xianyang on the way out of Xian.</p>
