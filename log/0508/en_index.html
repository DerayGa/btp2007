  <p class="style5">Look at Him! HELLO!</p>
  <p>“Beep! Beep! Beep!” My watch’s alarm went off at 5:20 am. </p>
  <p>After several days of trial, from waking up, washing up, getting dressed, packing bags, cleaning the room, </p>
  <p>checking Dido to loading bags onto Dido, all these activities takes approximately 40 minutes.  </p>
  <p>My ideal time to depart is 6 o’clock in the morning.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I happily enjoyed the breakfast.  It was the crystal cakes I bought at the muslin street yesterday.  </p>
  <p>The taste was a mixture of sweet and salty, very delicious.</p>
  <p>I had to resist the temptation to eat the crystal cakes since I bought them yesterday.  </p>
  <p>I had to wait until getting on the bike and this made me want to start the trip as soon as possible. </p>
  <p>Before I left Xi’an, I stopped by the train station to take a picture.  </p>
  <p>I don’t know whether it was too early in the morning or the fact that the Labor Day week was over, </p>
  <p>there weren’t that many people at the train station.</p>
  <p>Two days ago, here was packed with people and I had to avoid coming in this direction so I wouldn’t get stuck here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010575.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In order to leave Xi’an and head toward Boaji, I need to get on 310 national expressway. </p>
  <p>I went to the starting point of the Silk Road, where the statue was located, and thought I could find 310 national expressway there, but I ended up in Xianyang.<br />
    So I went around in cycles again and made a turn heading toward south.  I probably rode another extra 10 km or so.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today was a suitable day to ride bike.  There was no rain.  There were thick clouds in the sky so the sun ray wasn’t too strong.  </p>
  <p>Even the wind stopped blowing against me.</p>
  <p>Today’s goal was to ride from Xi’an to Boaji in one day.  When I looked at the map, I realized this was very far.  </p>
  <p>It probably was about 180 km.</p>
  <p>Why did I plan this aggressive schedule to get to Baoji from Xi’an in one day? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the end, I rode for 12 hours and more than 200 km in one day.  I really did get to Baoji from Xi’an in one day. </p>
  <p>After I found a place to stay over night and opened my laptop to check the schedule.  </p>
  <p>I realized I planned this trip for 2 days.  Daaaaa!</p>
  <p>Fortunately it was an easy ride today.  Now I got an extra day.  Later when I find a place I like, I can spend one extra day there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At noon, I arrived at a place called Zhouzhi County (here is the original destination for today);I had lunch at a small restaurant. </p>
  <p>There were many dishes written on the board.  But whatever I ordered, they were out.  </p>
  <p>Finally I asked them what they would recommend.</p>
  <p>Then the two boss ladies made a bowl of hand-stretched noodle with sesame sauce together.  </p>
  <p>Freshly made from the dough and then stretched it until it became wide and thin like fettuccini.</p>
  <p>Cooked with vegetables and topped with meat sauce and it’s done.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010593.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were no water nor tea served at the restaurant.  One of boss ladies brought me a scoop of noodle water.  </p>
  <p>The color of noodle water was in shade of green probably because it was cooked with vegetables.</p>
  <p>“People here all eat noodles and drink noodle water,” she said.</p>
  <p>When in Rome, do as the Romans do.  The noodles were very delicious.  </p>
  <p>The noodle water just like noodle water.  I portended I was drinking hot water.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010596.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After finished noodle and took a break.  </p>
  <p>I went to the grocery store next door and bought two popsicles.</p>
  <p>The boss lady from the noodle place said there were two foreigners bought some popsicles next door, too.  </p>
  <p>They even took a picture with her.</p>
  <p>When I heard that I was wondering if they were the members from B2P who left 2 weeks prior than me.</p>
  <p>So I was happily asking the boss lady how long ago was it?  Maybe I could catch up with them.</p>
  <p>Come to find out, it was back in February.  Then it wouldn’t be the people from B2P.  </p>
  <p>Since it has been a while, God knows where they are right now?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is my new equipment.  I bought it with 5 RMB in Xi’an.</p>
  <p>When you lift it up, it is a hat.  Pull it down; it can cover my whole face.  </p>
  <p>Whether they are bugs or western exposure sun, my face will be protected.</p>
  <p>When I wear this hat, because of the reflection, you can not see my face.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010603.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While I was wearing this sun hat, I ran into some elementary school students who were out for lunch break.  </p>
  <p>One of them saw me riding bike and shouted to his classmates.  “Look at him!”</p>
  <p>Then everyone was looking at me and in shocked for a split second.  Then someone started saying hello to me in English.</p>
  <p>『HELLO～』『HELLO～』『HELLO～』『HELLO～』『HELLO～』『HELLO～』</p>
  <p>『HELLO～』『HELLO～』『HELLO～』『HELLO～』『HELLO～』『HELLO～』</p>
  <p>It looked like they thought I was Mr. Bean.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There were nasty bugs everywhere along the road.  First, they would try to land on your body and then bite you.  </p>
  <p>So I have kept on patting down my jacket, pants, head piece and face.</p>
  <p>Even though I was wearing clothes, they could still bite through them.</p>
  <p>The worst area was the legs.  I was wearing every thick tights; they could still bite through them.</p>
  <p>Very often I had to stop because my legs were itchy.  </p>
  <p>I wondered if these bugs are afraid of bug spray.  But I didn’t bring any anyway.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Finally I found 310 national expressway after passing Zhouzhi.  Now there are 100 km from here to Boaji.</p>
  <p>So I rode 100 km this morning, rest a little bit, and I can ride another 100 km in the afternoon.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Because it was a long ride today, so I treated myself with a bottle of soda. </p>
  <p>I stopped at a grocery store in the mid way.  I went through their refrigerator looking for a bottle of soda.  </p>
  <p>Finally I found a bottle of Coke and the owner said it was 3 RMB.</p>
  <p>I said, is it 2.50 RMB the standard price?  Why here is 3 RMB?</p>
  <p>If that is the case, then I am going to buy one that is 2.50 RMB.  </p>
  <p>Which kind of soda is 2.50?  I continued to go through the refrigerator.</p>
  <p>Then, the owner’s son came out and saw me looking for a drink for 2.50 RMB and said, “Coca Cola is 2.50”</p>
  <p>The owner, who offered 3 RMB then portended to be busy and walked away.  </p>
  <p>You didn’t know one day you would be exposed by your own son?</p>
  <p>I took back the change.  You want to rip me off.  No way!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The road condition of 310 national expressway was generally fair.  The road was flat, no up and down hills.  </p>
  <p>But the repair site was very ridiculous.</p>
  <p>The repair site was about 20 km long and the estimated completion time was half year.  </p>
  <p>While the road was being repaired, it was still opened to public.</p>
  <p>It was very chaotic.  There were potholes every where. If I wasn’t careful, I could fall into 2 meters deep holes. </p>
  <p>Instead saying it was being repaired, it’s better to say they were trying to burry something secretly along this 20 km long road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010604.jpg" width="900" height="509" /></p>
  <p>When the road condition was better, I could enjoy the country scenery.</p>
  <p>There were plenty of wheat plantations.  Some of them were planting vegetables or fruit trees.</p>
  <p>Then they were goats and chicken running around.  The adult goats were eating grass, </p>
  <p>baby goats were drinking milk, and chickens were digging dirt.  What a leisure country life!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010610.jpg" width="900" height="509" /></p>
  <p>I had to be careful not to get side track too much, otherwise, I would really fall into the potholes and couldn’t get out of them.</p>
  <p>Riding along the road and moving forward.  At 6:30 pm, I had reached 200 km milestone and arrived Baoji city.</p>
  <p>There were many hotels, motels and guest houses.  When you find a cheap one, don’t be too thrilled yet.</p>
  <p>You have to check the room first to make sure it is clean.  </p>
  <p>Don’t be too tough on yourself just because you want to save money.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010615.jpg" width="900" height="509" /></p>
  <p>I pay special attention to the owners’ eyes and tones when I asking for prices</p>
  <p>Some of them won’t look into your eyes or not telling the price directly. </p>
  <p>Those are the ones checking you out to see how much money they can rip you off.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today I found a hotel that was owned by a couple seems to be newlywed.  20 RMB a night.</p>
  <p>Now whenever they asked for an ID during check in, it is not a problem anymore.</p>
  <p>“I am traveling right now and don’t have IDs with me because I don’t want to lose them.  Can I just write them for you?”</p>
  <p>Then I just made up that I live in Beijing Chaoyang Road Number 30.  Use my real name and ID number probability has 25 digits long or so.</p>
  <p>Who can remember their own ID number?  So I would say I don’t remember and that everything is been taking care of.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At night, I asked the lady where I could find a good bowl of shaozi noodle.</p>
  <p>Friends told me what when I am in Baoji, I have to try shaozi noodle.  </p>
  <p>Since I will be leaving Baoji tomorrow, I have to have it for dinner.</p>
  <p>I found a noodle house in a busy street and it was packed with people inside.  This place must have a good reputation.</p>
  <p>I ordered a bowl of shaozi noodle and mapo bean curd.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before my food was ready, I was reading the introduction of shaozi noodle hung on the wall.</p>
  <p>According to legend, this dish was invented by King Wen’s mom from Zhou Dynasty.</p>
  <p>Shaozi noodle can be described in 9 words and they are “thin, tough, smooth, hot, watery, oily, sour, spicy, and aromatic”</p>
  <p>Then my shaozi noodle was ready.  It was made with very thin white noodle. Very soft but not mushy.</p>
  <p>The broth is sour and spicy.  It is a clear broth, no starch.  There were julienne vegetable.  This was very good.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There was tons of hot oil in mapo bean curd.  No more than a couple of bites of bean curd, my tongue became numbed again.</p>
  <p>It tasted very good.  I really wanted to eat it with a bowl of steamed rice, but I was stuffed after finished a bowl of noodle.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Stopped by at a grocery store before got back to the hotel and bought 2 bags of chocolate milk for breakfast tomorrow and a box of cookies. </p>
  <p>I also bought a bottle of Sprite to comfort my senseless tongue. </p>
  <p><br />
    Today is an ordinary day but everything went very smoothly.  </p>
  <p>It would be nice if every day is like today, a good day for cycling.</p>
