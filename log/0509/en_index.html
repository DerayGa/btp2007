  <p class="style5">There is a First Time for Every Thing</p>
  <p>I went to bed later than normal last night.  </p>
  <p>I was up late reading “One Hundred Years of Solitude” and couldn’t put it down.  </p>
  <p>So this morning I had hard time getting up.  By the time I departed it was 7 o’clock already.</p>
  <p>Baoji city is in a rectangular shape.   So I will ride from east to west to across the whole city today.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010617.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>About 8 o’clock, just as I was leaving Baoji, I heard a very familiar music broadcasted from a loudspeaker.</p>
  <p>“Stretching exercises, 1, 2, 3, 4 … “ Isn’t that the national exercise routines that we had to do in the elementary school?</p>
  <p>Even the music and commands were exactly the same!  I stopped and watched the students doing the same exercise </p>
  <p>routines as I did when I was in school.  Oh, the good old days.</p>
  <p>I turned around and looked up.  When I saw the school name, it made me laugh so hard.  </p>
  <p>The name of this school is “Shaanxi Province Baoji Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory Children School” :-)</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010622.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While I was looking for the road to Tianshui, I accidentally climbed up a hill.</p>
  <p>But that is ok because I will have to climb many hills today and one more hill is not going to hurt.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010627.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The roads from Baoji to Tianshui were between valleys so there were less climbing up and down the mountains.  </p>
  <p>But occasionally I still had to climb up and down the mountains. </p>
  <p><br />
    Today is the first time that I have to go through a tunnel.  </p>
  <p>I was worry that my GPS wouldn’t be able to receive signals while I was in the tunnel and it would mess up the track.</p>
  <p>I stopped after passed through a tunnel and checked the GPS.  </p>
  <p>There was only a small section of track was messed up.  Overall, it was pretty precise. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010632.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The tunnels here were pretty scary.  They were all 1 – 2 km long.  Some were a little bit longer.  </p>
  <p>But none of them had lights or they only had very dim yellow lights.  </p>
  <p>For cars, it might not matter because cars have head lights. </p>
  <p>But for cyclists, this is the worst nightmare.  </p>
  <p>First of all, I was afraid that I might get tripped over because it was so dark inside the tunnel. </p>
  <p>Second, I was afraid that I might get run over from cars behind me. </p>
  <p><br />
    Before entering the tunnel, I took of the sun hat and changed my sunglasses to the regular glasses;otherwise I would be blind as a bat.</p>
  <p>Then I changed the red taillight to blinking mode and turned on Dido’s headlight.</p>
  <p>Luckily Dido has a petal powered generated lights.  </p>
  <p>I only have to turn on the switch and while I am riding the bike, it will generate enough electricity to keep the headlight on.</p>
  <p>This way I don’t have to worry about running out of batteries and the halogen lamp was bright enough for me to see.</p>
  <p>Good thing there weren’t that many cars here (there were more trucks though).  </p>
  <p>Traffic was pretty light, so it wasn’t that difficult to pass through the tunnels safely. </p>
  <p>Throughout the day, I probability passed 6 or 7 tunnels.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is another first time.  Right after I passed the first tunnel, I got my first flat tire. </p>
  <p>Because of the construction, either the road condition was very bad or there was only a small path.  </p>
  <p>From the surface it shouldn’t be any problem.  But you get a flat tire as soon as you get on the road.</p>
  <p>It broke my heart when I saw the front wheel had a flat tire.  I moved the bike to the side of the 15th branch.</p>
  <p>I was looking for a shady spot to change the inner tube.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010640.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Unload the 3 bags at the front, disassemble the front wheel, took out tools and spare inner tube, now I am ready to change tire.</p>
  <p>It has been a long time since I had to change the inner tube.  </p>
  <p>After the bike tour in France, I haven’t had any opportunity to change tire myself.  </p>
  <p>I almost forgot how to do this if it wasn’t for this time.</p>
  <p>There were broken glasses that had poked through the outer tube and into the inner tube.  </p>
  <p>You can’t tell really from the surface.  There were just very small holes. </p>
  <p>In order to take out the broken glasses, I had to pried open the outer tube, </p>
  <p>and then used a small tweezer to pull out the broken glasses one at a time.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010641.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While I was changing the inner tube, people from the 15th branch came over and watched me getting flustered.</p>
  <p>The 15th branch is the unit that is in charge of the construction here.  </p>
  <p>I told them that I had a flat tire while I was riding on the path in front of us.  </p>
  <p>“The road condition is very bad and please fix them.”</p>
  <p>The highway they are working on right now is called Bao Tian Highway, which is from Baoji to Tianshui.</p>
  <p>The construction will finish next year, in the mean time, this impacts a lot of national freeways and the road condition becomes very bad.</p>
  <p>I took me about half hour to fix the flat tire while chitchatting with the workers from the 15th branch. </p>
  <p>Before I left, I asked them to fill my water bottles.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today again is a bright sunny day.  I have been wearing the sun hat since this morning.  </p>
  <p>I drank a lot of water and got all sweaty. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010665.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Riding along the valleys, obviously there were less roadside shops and fewer towns.  </p>
  <p>There were only a few restaurants and body shops open along the roadway. </p>
  <p>Lunch time, I stopped at a small restaurant and order half kilogram of dumplings.  This time, there were 30 dumplings :-)</p>
  <p>During lunch time, I found out that the owner is one of the construction workers.  </p>
  <p>This is a very difficult construction.  In order to build highway as straight as possible,</p>
  <p> they have to build bridges to cross rivers and tunnels through mountains.  </p>
  <p>I don’t know when they will be able to finish the construction.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010661.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While I was eating dumplings, there was a loud sound, “BOOM!”</p>
  <p>It scared me to death, but the owner seemed like didn’t even hear that.  I asked him what was that?</p>
  <p>Come to find out, they were blowing up the mountain to build tunnels.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>What? I had to ride along the construction site and they were using the explosives.  Is it dangerous?</p>
  <p>Oh, don’t worry about it,” the owner said casually while smoking.  </p>
  <p>But the sound of explosion was still lingering in the valley.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Not long after the lunch time, I have passed through the border between Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.  </p>
  <p>Just a plain road sign indicated I have finished another province.</p>
  <p>The distance to Tianshui is about 180 kilometers.  </p>
  <p>I didn’t want to make it too aggressive so I am going to make it a 2-day trip.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010663.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After arrive Gansu and rode a little bit more, I can start looking for a place to stay over night around 3 – 4 o’clock in the afternoon.  </p>
  <p>I want to get plenty of rest so I can continue to ride tomorrow.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>3:30 in the afternoon, I decided to stay at a roadside hotel.  </p>
  <p>This hotel is owned by a couple and their son.</p>
  <p>The name of this town is called “Dizhuang”.  What a simple name.  </p>
  <p>I don’t think I will need to use the tent in China because there are lodging places everywhere.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010668.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was only 10 RMB a night here and there was a nice breeze at the front door.</p>
  <p>I got a bucket of cold water from the well, had a sponge bath and then rinsed the outfit I was wearing earlier.</p>
  <p>Took the clothes the roof, grandma gave me bamboo pole to line dry my clothes.</p>
  <p>Today the sun is very bright with strong wind.  My clothes were dried in an hour.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010675.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I ordered a bowl of braised noodle and I thought the grandma would be the one who cooked.  </p>
  <p>But ended up it was the son.</p>
  <p>It was surprisingly delicious.  There were green peppers, cabbages, bean curds, tomatoes and shredded pork with hand-made noodle.</p>
  <p>The soup was spicy with a touch of sweet and sour, not greasy at all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010670.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The owner’s son learned how to cook in Baoji.  He had also a year of experience at a restaurant in Beijing.</p>
  <p>That’s why his cooking was super delicious.  I complimented him about his cooking.  He was very humble and said, </p>
  <p>“No, the taste is not quite there, yet.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I pulled a stood and sit at the front door just like them.  The wind was blowing.  </p>
  <p>At this moment, it didn’t matter whether the wind was blowing with me or against me as long as it was a breeze.</p>
  <p>I drank the cold beer that the owner had put in the refrigerator for me earlier while enjoyed the beautiful mountain view.</p>
  <p>When I was riding, I had to pay attention for the road condition.  </p>
  <p>If I wanted to enjoy the view, I had to either stop the bike or fall off the bike.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is the view from the back of the house.  You can climb these mountains.  It must be very beautiful up there.</p>
  <p>The little house in the lower left hand corner is the bathroom.  The smell was very strong.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010676.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After finished one bottle of beer, I asked the owner to put another one in the refrigerator.  </p>
  <p>Later, I will ask the son to cook something delicious to go with the beer (mouth watering)</p>
