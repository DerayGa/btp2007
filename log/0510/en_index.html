  <p class="style5">Icy Rain</p>
  <p>4 o'clock in the morning, I got up to pee outside. Man, it was freezing!</p>
  <p>It was really cold even in the dawn, Shivering, I finished peeing, and ran back to the bed. </p>
  <p>I couldn't sleep much last night because of the noise from people drinking and shouting until almost midnight. </p>
  <p>Plus there was another person joining me in this room out of nowhere, snoring like thunder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I woke up at 6 o'clock again in the morning, so did that snoring guy. </p>
  <p>It turned out he drank with a bunch of his friends, and the son of that restaurant owner—also the chef, </p>
  <p>total 9 people, finished seven &quot;kun&quot;s of beers. </p>
  <p>What is KUN again? Never heard of, all I know was six packs. </p>
  <p>They told me each &quot;kun&quot; is 9 beers; they must be crazy to finish 63 beers in one night.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After 6:30, I was ready to leave, but the restaurant was still closed, how was I supposed to fill up water and get my deposit back? </p>
  <p>I went to the back of the restaurant, second floor, woke up the son of the owner to let him know I was leaving. </p>
  <p>After getting the water, I bought 2 RMB's worth of buns for breakfast, and started my trip.  It was already 7 o'clock, but it still looked like only 5. </p>
  <p>No sun, foggy, and cool, maybe 18 deg C? </p>
  <p>I was actually very glad to see this: cooler, no sun, great for biking. <br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010687.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because of the unbearable stinky smell, I couldn't &quot;take a dump&quot; at the restroom, then …. </p>
  <p>Only one hour or so later, I really needed to go, but WHERE? </p>
  <p>I parked Dido next to the sign &quot;Falling Rock&quot;, which was just by a rock. </p>
  <p>Then I went to the back of it, taking my time while looking at those mountains.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010694.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On the way, I saw a dog walking back-and-forth on the roadside, my instinct told me it was not a good sign. </p>
  <p>I took out my CS gas, just in case. Exactly like I expected, as soon as I rode pass that dog, it ran after me immediately closely but quietly. </p>
  <p>I guess this was what Chinese said&quot; only the quite dog bites&quot;. </p>
  <p>I aimed the gas to that dog a couple of times, but it was still running right after me. </p>
  <p>I was ready to give it some kicks when it was running close enough, then it slowed down.  </p>
  <p>I wondered it was because that dog was too tired or my CS gas finally worked.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Three hours later, I had my first rain in my trip.</p>
  <p>The rain came so quickly that I didn't get to find a place to hide, surely I was wet right away. </p>
  <p>However, it was cloudy and no sign of heavy rain, so I was struggling if I should put on my rain gear, </p>
  <p>and if I should wrap up my backpacks with waterproof covers.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010701.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Within 5 minutes, the rain stopped, I was very happy and proud that I didn't stop for the rain earlier.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>According to my map, I was supposed to leave the mountainous area after like 50 km.  </p>
  <p>Already riding for 70 km later, and I was still here, how strange! </p>
  <p>I had the Lanzhuo beef noodle soup at Boyang. </p>
  <p>The noodle was thin, the soup was great, but the beef was tiny. </p>
  <p>It reminded me of the 15 NTD instant beef noodle with only 2-3 pieces of dried beef bits in Taiwan.</p>
  <p>I should not complain the size of the beef since it cost only 3 RMB.  But, </p>
  <p>I was really not talking about the SIZE of the beef, I was asking &quot;WHERE&quot; was the beef.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I didn't stay for too long, because I didn't want to catch the rain again.  </p>
  <p>I got on my bike soon after lunch, and it was already too late.<br />
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010706.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was still debating if I should put on my rain gear this time, maybe it would stop 5 minutes later just like the last time. </p>
  <p>I was completely wrong. </p>
  <p>It rained harder and harder, I was like a frog in a heating pot. </p>
  <p>I didn't want to put on rain coat at the beginning because I was lazy.   But now, I was so pissed that I didn't want to put it on. </p>
  <p>I wanted to see how bad it can be anyway since I was already soaking wet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, I biked in the pouring rain for over an hour.  I was cold and wet; even my glasses were dripping water. </p>
  <p>I finally saw a Muslim restaurant, I stopped to have some hot soup, also let my Dido rest a bit. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010708.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Took off my head wrap, I was so sure that I would catch cold if I continue biking like this.</p>
  <p>I wringed the water out of my coat, shirt, socks and shoes. </p>
  <p>Then I had some hot tea, some cumin lamb chop and hot-and-sour pork soup. </p>
  <p>I knew I just had lunch, but I was so hungry after biking in the rain. </p>
  <p>I wanted to eat something hot to squeeze the &quot;coldness&quot; out of my body.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The rain was much lighter after I swept all the food on the plate and ready to go. </p>
  <p>But it was windy, and I was still shivering. </p>
  <p>I gave up being stubborn, put on my expensive rain coat. </p>
  <p>Wow! This is why this thing was so expensive.  My body felt warm immediately.  </p>
  <p>This coat kept cold air from coming in and slowly venting the humidity out.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Don't think the rain was so pure and clean, the mud-like mark on my glasses was the evidence. </p>
  <p>I had to change to another pair of glasses and continued biking. </p>
  <p>Even though the wind blew gently, my clothes also began to dry slowly, it was still pretty cold. </p>
  <p>I started to worry about those backpacks on my bike. I didn't put on anything waterproof on them, I hoped they were alright.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While I was riding uphill earlier, there were five kids trying to drag my attention. </p>
  <p>I was so tired and it was raining, I didn't have any energy to deal with them. </p>
  <p>They thought I was not Chinese since I didn't respond to them at all, they started to scorn me in Japanese. </p>
  <p>What a bunch of terrible kids.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By the time I finished the steep uphill and downhill biking, I finally entered the city area. </p>
  <p>I thought it was Tianshui, my destination today, so I was ready to take a rest.</p>
  <p>It was only 80 km or so, I felt more tiresome than finishing a 200-km biking trip. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010720.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After checking into a hotel and paying for 15 RMB a night, I changed into dry clothes and opened all my backpacks to let dry. </p>
  <p>I was totally satisfied with these bags; they were really water-proof. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010726.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> Finally I checked the GPS tracker and found I was only at Beidao, </p>
  <p>not Tianshui, which was only 20 km away, I stopped too early. </p>
  <p>I wrapped myself in the blanket and felt my body finally started to warm up. </p>
  <p>I was very sleepy at this moment, but there is no way I should sleep so early. It was only 3:00 in the afternoon.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I spent my time at the internet café. I was a veteran of such place now. </p>
  <p>The only problem was, computers in these places offered all types of Chinese input methods EXCEPT phonetic, which is the only method I know. </p>
  <p>If the computer was not that strictly monitored, I would install the phonetic program to type Chinese; </p>
  <p>otherwise, I had to use my very limited English to surf online. </p>
  <p>I was so glad to see other B2P members were having a good time, </p>
  <p>some were even in the middle of the desert, I was so jealous of them. </p>
  <p>I probably can be one of them a week from now?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had such a big lunch that I can still taste the cumin lamb chop. </p>
  <p>Not much of appetite for dinner, I had some five-spice peanuts and fruit-flavored milk instead.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I was ready to read a bit and go to sleep, the hotel staff just opened the door and brought a guy with a beard to share the room with me. </p>
  <p>The only catch of staying in such a cheap two-bed room was, you might have to SHARE with anybody the hotel brings to you. </p>
  <p>Thank god he looked like a nice guy, but I still reorganized my stuff all around me. Hey, you never know.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This guy was a truck driver, who was originally from Chongqing. </p>
  <p>After chatting with him, I found that driving a truck is an interesting job. </p>
  <p>He transports goods from point A to point B, then he would look for next delivery at B. </p>
  <p>It seems like there are some places that most truck drivers can get business from.  </p>
  <p>This guy will take anything he can get his hands on, and moves to C, and the same cycle continues. </p>
  <p>To a certain extend, this is a life of driving while traveling, you don't know where you will end up tomorrow,</p>
  <p> kind of sad and cool at the same time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since this guy was a truck driver, I asked for his opinions about  planning my route to Lanzhou tomorrow. </p>
  <p>The conclusion was, no matter which way I choose: Rt 316 south or local at north, </p>
  <p>I have to go around many mountains; there was no easy route for biking. </p>
  <p>If I can't get on highway, I was definitely having sore legs after tomorrow. </p>
  <p>Staring at my map, I really can't decide what to do tomorrow.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Rt 316 south, was a national highway, so it should be easier for me.  </p>
  <p>There would be food and lodge available everywhere. </p>
  <p>However, the national highway was full of trucks, they honked me all the time, </p>
  <p>whih was really annoying. Plus it was a bit detour for me, longer distance to Lanzhou.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the local road at the north was not even on my map (or my map sucks?), it looked a shorter distance to Lanzhou. </p>
  <p>But I had to worry about getting lost, and maybe the road condition was very bad, which might make my life much more difficult.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Both routes have its pros and cons.  The national highway is a safe bet, surely I can arrive my destination eventually. </p>
  <p>But my experience so far told me that local roads had better scenic views, even I was so lost at that time,</p>
  <p> I still liked that better than biking on the boring national highways, which almost made me fall asleep while I was on it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To go for national highway or not, this is the question, and thinking of it made me so sleepy…. </p>
  <p>I made sure everything was secured around me before I went to sleep. </p>
  <p>Even though that truck driver looked like a nice guy, but like I said, you never know.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Let me go to sleep earlier today to recharge my energy. Sleeping is great! Snoozing is fun!</p>
