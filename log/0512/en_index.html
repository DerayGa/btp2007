  <p class="style5">On the way to Lanzhou</p>
  <p>It was late when I settled down for the night yesterday. I finished my dinner after 9:00pm, </p>
  <p>and then stayed up till midnight writing my trip log.</p>
  <p>I work up before 6:00am as usual, but slept in till 8:00am because today’s ride was short, about 80 km.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before set off, I was thinking of buying a bag of brown sugar for making hot brown sugar water, </p>
  <p>but could not find a place selling it. Moreover, my powder drink mix was running low, only one bag of Milo left. I needed to stock up.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I wanted to take the same road that I used yesterday, but I was stopped by the toll booth operator, </p>
  <p>he said that bicycles were not allowed on the road.</p>
  <p>The operator was right. I saw a road sign saying this road was for cars, but I had no idea why I could get on yesterday.</p>
  <p>“I got off the road for accommodation yesterday and how come I could not get back on today?” </p>
  <p>I said to the operator</p>
  <p>“Bicycles are not allowed on the road by the book, I am not sure why the previous operator would allow you to get on” </p>
  <p>said the operator</p>
  <p>Perhaps I was able to clearly describe how I got on the road at Taian the day before </p>
  <p>and what I had planned to continue riding to Dingxi on the same road for today. </p>
  <p>The operator was finally convinced that I knew what I was doing and let me get back on the road.</p>
  <p>“Very well” shouted in my mind.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There was only one rest area between Tongwei and Dingxi, about 26 km from Tongwei. </p>
  <p>This ride could be exceptionally boring since there were only two places to explore, </p>
  <p>the rest area and Dingxi, and nothing along the way.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010861.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I decided to ride casually to the rest area, Maying, for lunch. </p>
  <p>Nothing happened all the way to Maying except that some honey bees bumped into my head which happened so fast </p>
  <p>that I did not have time to react and dodge them. </p>
  <p>The bump did not hurt, but it was a very solid hit.</p>
  <p>After several honey bee “collisions”, I arrived at Maying. </p>
  <p>I had scallion scrambled eggs and large serving of rice for lunch. The food was quite tasty. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010863.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The morning ride was easy and short so I did not take a break after lunch, </p>
  <p>but continued riding toward Dingxi. Hopefully I could find a place to sleep earlier today.</p>
  <p>The sun was mild the whole day long. The temperature was cool at 2000m above sea level. </p>
  <p>Even at high noon, the temperature was still around 20 degree Celsius. </p>
  <p>The ride was boring, but it was smooth. I did not expect anything fun before arriving at Lanzhou. </p>
  <p>If someone stopped me right now and asked me where I was going, I would not hesitate to reply</p>
  <p> “on the way to Lanzhou” </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010858.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were some terraced fields along the road, but nothing grew in the fields. </p>
  <p>Was it because that Gansu province was short of water?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010865.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were no shops along the way, I did not even have a chance to waste my money. </p>
  <p>I just listened to the music and had my mind go blank while riding, or played the game </p>
  <p>“guess the vehicle type by listening to its horn” when I got bored.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I got into Dingxi at 3:00pm which was ahead of my schedule. </p>
  <p>I thought Dingxi was a small town, but it was the size of a city. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010871.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I wandered around Dingxi on Dido. There were quite a few hotels. </p>
  <p>I wondered if there were many people who came here specifically for the accommodations. </p>
  <p>I was looking for a hostel close to Internet cafés, so I could walk over to the Internet café in my slippers from the hostel. </p>
  <p>I had no idea why it became harder to communicate even though I was speaking Mandarin. </p>
  <p>It was no longer necessary to mimic a Beijing accent. </p>
  <p>Now, I spoke with my Taiwanese accent so I could pronounce words better and made it easier for me to communicate.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The room rate was 20 RMB for one night. But for today, </p>
  <p>I cared less about the room rate than to find a place where I could take a shower and do laundry. </p>
  <p>I had not showered for three days, and my clothes and socks had not been washed for three days as well.</p>
  <p>I wanted to buy laundry detergent powder which was much more effective than soap. </p>
  <p>The hotel clerk loaned me a bag when he learned that I wanted to do my laundry.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010877.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> I went to the restroom, filled a washing up bowl from the faucet, </p>
  <p>then took sponge bath and washed my hair. Only half way through, </p>
  <p>somebody knocked on the door and said “stop washing, we are flooded”</p>
  <p>Oh, man! I looked down and found no drainage hole in the floor. </p>
  <p>The dirty water flowed through the door and ran from the second floor to the first floor along the staircase. </p>
  <p>When the hotel clerk on the first floor saw the water coming down, he hurried up to stop me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The situation was not so bad, only restroom, corridor, two empty rooms, </p>
  <p>staircase and first floor were flooded. I got the hotel into trouble within 10 minutes of checking in!</p>
  <p>The hotel clerk swept the water into a dustpan, scooped the water into a washing up bowl, </p>
  <p>and then poured the water into toilet. I helped pouring water into the toilet to express my regret.</p>
  <p>It took half an hour to take care of the “disaster”. I was terribly sorry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Later on, I was very careful when washing clothes. </p>
  <p>I poured the dirty water into the toilet and did not let any water get onto the floor.</p>
  <p>Finally, I felt squeaky clean and my clothes were hung to dry. </p>
  <p>Tomorrow, I could continue my journey in the same clothes with the nice scent of detergent powder.</p>
  <p>If everything went smoothly as planned, I would be in Lanzhou tomorrow.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had Lanzhou beef noodle for dinner at the restaurant next door. </p>
  <p>Even with no beef in the noodles, the noodle soup was excellent and worthy every penny.</p>
  <p>In addition, the noodle was made right in front of me after asking me what kind of noodle I liked, wide or thin. </p>
  <p>I enjoyed watching noodle making. The taste of the hand-rolled noodle was excellent. </p>
  <p>The cashier register showed 2.9 RMB for my dinner. </p>
  <p>I never wanted to keep the ten RMB cents change so I always bought more to round up the number. </p>
  <p>This time I needed five beef noodles to round it up, a bit too much for my stomach. </p>
  <p>I said “do you accept tips?” then left the ten RMB cents at the cashier. The cashier took the change with a smile.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The brown sugar was sold at the “Cigarette, Sugar, and Alcohol Wholesale Department of Dingxi”, </p>
  <p>a large bag of the brown sugar was just 2.5 RMB. The sugar was a bit hard but the taste was the same. </p>
  <p>Drinking the brown sugar water before sleep warmed up my body and made me feel comfy.</p>
