  <p class="style5">Natu： ~ Kayo Arai ~</p>
  <p>As I was walking Dido out of the room, I saw a flat back tire.</p>
  <p>How could it be flat; I haven’t even started to ride yet</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was fortunate that I noticed it in the room so it would be easier for me to fix it.</p>
  <p>I took a closer look and saw that a piece of wire thinner then hair punctured the inner tube.<br />
    <br />
    The hole was so small I didn’t notice when it happened, and after air leaking all night I got my second flat tire.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>I wanted to try something different for breakfast this morning, </p>
  <p>so I got some bread at 50 cents apiece. It looked sweet, more to my taste.</p>
  <p>It tasted kind of like steamed sponge cake.  I seem to be pretty good at choosing food </p>
  <p>(or maybe it’s just because I’m not picky. =..=)</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010880.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Following the road I came from, Lanzhou is only 110 km ahead. </p>
  <p>If all goes well, I should be able to make it today, but that’s if all goes well…</p>
  <p>Sure enough, this road disappeared not long after I left DingXi.   There were two roads that diverged in a yellow wood. </p>
  <p>I took the one less traveled by, only because there were bicycle tracks on the dirt road.</p>
  <p>And that made all the difference. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010884.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After riding for about 10 km, as I was distracted; I heard someone say hello to me from the opposite lane in a very weird accent. </p>
  <p>And that’s how I meat Natu, another bike traveler. </p>
  <p>She was a Korean born in Japan, 28 years old.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010887.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Starting from Shanghai on March 19th,  she took almost two months to get to where she is now, because she only rides 50 km a day. </p>
  <p>When I first saw her, the first thought that passed my mind was ~ </p>
  <p>How did she do it with such little luggage?</p>
  <p>Then, what does that make me look like with all this stuff? @@”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>What made us the same was that we were both heading toward Lanzhou. </p>
  <p>But, how could that be? </p>
  <p>We’re on the same road, both going to Lanzhou, </p>
  <p>then why is she coming from that way and I’m coming from this way? What is going on?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One of us must be going the wrong way. After asking a guy riding by on a motorcycle, </p>
  <p>we found out that it was I who was going the wrong way. Orz </p>
  <p>The guy said that we should turn back and go on the highway.</p>
  <p>But…But can we really ride on the highway? @@”</p>
  <p>And I only ended up here because I didn’t choose the highway at the diverged roads.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Maybe I should have took the road more traveled by after all. </p>
  <p>Following the guy’s directions, we went to try our luck on the highway. But our luck ran out before even getting to the tollbooth. /_\</p>
  <p>What on earth should we do now? We have already taken both roads, </p>
  <p>there’s no other way to go; could turning back to DingXi be our only choice?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010889.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A traffic control fellow told us that there was this little path that we could take, </p>
  <p>but it wouldn’t be easy. It was our only option, so we took it. </p>
  <p>It was really a very small road, and because of going astray this morning, it was already high noon and I had only advanced 40 km.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/RIMG1337.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had lunch at a little town, sweet bean sauce noodles with beer. </p>
  <p>The sun was at its highest; I would have got sunstroke if I hadn’t had something cool.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This was from Natu’s notebook, she is learning Mandarin and Chinese food as she travels:</p>
  <p>“Eating is a way of learning” that’s what she said. =..=</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010893.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I thought the road was bad, it soon got worse. What we were riding on after lunch could barely be called a road. </p>
  <p>It was just a dirt path going along the railway. ~_~</p>
  <p>Would this really lead to Lanzhou? </p>
  <p>I had my doubts, but we had no choice but to keep on going.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010901.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After following this path for a while, we came to the side gate of a train station. </p>
  <p>OK, I guess we’re really lost now~ </p>
  <p>Since there’s not much we could do about it, why not take a break at the train station. </p>
  <p>The staff at the train station were very friendly, we had fresh water and got to get out of the sun. </p>
  <p>This was a very small station, no trains seemed to stop here, but the staff still greeted every train as it went by.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010904.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After resting for half an hour, we moved on. </p>
  <p>The staff at the train station said that we would have to climb a mountain called High Cliff Mountain. </p>
  <p>Just the sound of it was scary enough, but actually it was even more outrageous then that.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/RIMG1340.jpg" width="900" height="1200" /></p>
  <p>There were many places we had to walk our bikes through. Some slopes were over 35 degrees. </p>
  <p>There was no way we could ride up. To add to that it was a dirt road covered with gravel. </p>
  <p>Holding our bikes we climbed up this 2000m mountain, but when we got to the top, the view was absolutely spectacular.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010920.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This was an exclusive view for crazy bikers, and I stood and sucked it all in. </p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/u4WB4QCf5cw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>It moved me deeply.</p>  
  <p><img src="photo/P1010918.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010922.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Riding down the mountain brought us to a town called High Cliff Town.</p>
  <p>I was riding in front of Natu, so I looked back once in a while to see if she was still there. </p>
  <p>But when I looked back when I got to the town, </p>
  <p>I DIDN’T SEE HER.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Worriedly, I rode back to see what might have happened.</p>
  <p>It turned out that she had had a flat tire.</p>
  <p>I thought that this shouldn’t be a big problem, because she has ridden around Japan two times before, </p>
  <p>once in three months and once in one month.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A flat tire should be a piece of cake for her.</p>
  <p>After all she has ridden from Shanghai to Lanzhou, then from there she was going to ride another five months. </p>
  <p>Going from Lanzhou to Lhasa, then to Nepal, after that India, then to Thailand, and from Thailand to Hong Kong.</p>
  <p>THAT’S QUITE A WAY TO RIDE. </p>
  <p>She's got to be kidding if she didn’t bring any inner tubes or repair tools for her bike.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But that seemed to be the case.</p>
  <p>SHE HAD BROUGHT NOTHING！！！！/_\</p>
  <p>No wonder she had such little luggage. Trying to ride a journey like this without any supplements, that was really gambling with your life.</p>
  <p>She already had two flat tires on this trip, fortunately both times happened in a city, and there are bike shops all over the place in China.</p>
  <p>So she thought that there would be no problem finding someplace to fix her bike, and it was cheap too. She said an inner tube only cost 10 RMB.</p>
  <p>But what I was worried about wasn’t the question of finding a shop or if it was cheap or not. </p>
  <p>Rather, what if the bike broke down in the middle of nowhere; what could she do then?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010897.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Anyway, we walked her bike to a bike shop. The owner knew how to change it,</p>
  <p> but he didn’t have the material (size 26C inner tube). He would have it tomorrow, he said. </p>
  <p>So I gave her one of mine for the time being, and helped the owner change it.</p>
  <p>Using our own inner tube, it only cost 3 RMB.</p>
  <p>We found out that what caused the flat tire was not because something punctured it, </p>
  <p>but because the lining inside of the frame was all worn out, and the inner tube was rubbing against the screws on the frame of the tire.</p>
  <p>At a shop that doesn’t even have an inner tube, I guess asking if they could replace the lining was out of the question. I was right.</p>
  <p>So we taped up the ruined lining, hoping that it would hold for a while.  </p>
  <p>Knowing that this wouldn't hold forever, we had to find a bigger bike shop that could replace it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/RIMG0522.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After this fix, it was already five o’clock, so we decided to call it a day at this Town of the High Cliff. </p>
  <p>It was about 70 km from Lanzhou, so we should be able to get there by noon tomorrow.</p>
  <p>There was only one very small hotel in town. With a record breaking price of 5 RMB a night,</p>
  <p> up until now this was the cheapest hotel on this journey.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There was this little kid in the hotel, </p>
  <p>He was four years old and had a red face like all the other kids around, taken care by his grandma.  </p>
  <p>They called him “Daka” (at least that’s what it sounded like ~_~).</p>
  <p>He really enjoyed playing with Natu.</p>
  <p>I don’t really know how to play with children so I gave him some candy that I bought two weeks before; </p>
  <p>somehow was still there  Then I lent him my sun cap.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010930.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Gansu is really a very dry place; there were no faucets in the hotel.  All there were was a water vat to wash your face ：D </p>
  <p>And, after you washed your face you shouldn’t just pour the water on the floor. </p>
  <p>What you should do is to put the water into a bigger vat so that they could use it for irrigation.</p>
  <p>I learned this the hard way, because when I poured the water on the floor, </p>
  <p>the old lady at the hotel said to me in an anguished way that I shouldn’t have done that.</p>
  <p>I’m sure every drop of water is precious here, because all the farms are covered with a transparent plastic cloth to prevent dehydration.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Natu was really a beer lover; she could ride with no supplements, but she would never forget to bring her bottle opener. XD </p>
  <p>For dinner at this small town we had kung bao pork, beef noodles and vegetables.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Thanks to Natu, it was easier for me to take pictures today.</p>
  <p>Actually it took me a long time to think about if I should put Natu in my travel notes.</p>
  <p>Because many of you might think  “Wow, an encounter with a beautiful woman”.</p>
  <p><br />
    I had thought that maybe if I didn’t write about it that would save me some trouble, </p>
  <p>but then I thought “nothing really happened, it was just two people meeting on the way. Why should I care what other people think.”</p>
  <p><br />
    After Lanzhou, one was heading toward Sinkiang, and the other toward Tibet. </p>
  <p>But we were both dreamers carrying out our dreams.</p>
