  <p class="style5">Lanzhou, city of unfamilarity</p>
  <p>Before I am took the trip and even now, people who knew about my trip all caringly reminded me to “be careful”, a heart warming gesture. </p>
  <p>But I have always felt a sense of freedom, lonely perhaps, but free. After all, I am a “man”, </p>
  <p>I am simply enjoying this moment in life, the care freeness it offers and trying not to be a burden for anyone.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The further I traveled toward the North West, the bigger the difference in temperature between night and day. </p>
  <p>There’s a saying here, “mesh for day and leather for night”. </p>
  <p>My dress code has now changed from a lightweight Anti Perspiration top to a heavier weight Anti Perspiration top. </p>
  <p>It keeps me warmer but it isn’t absorbing the sweat as well as the lightweight version.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before “Taka” the four year old kiddo is about to go to school, his grandmother put some tissues in his backpack. </p>
  <p>Not to be out done, I put what left (about half full still) of the sweets I bought yesterday in his backpack too. </p>
  <p>Kiddo, take it slow. If you get cavities, don’t blame me, OK? Taka also wanted to go to school with my “Sun Block Cap”, </p>
  <p>but his grandmother forced it off his little head and then Taka burst into a loud speaker with tears. XD</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The goal today is the city Lanzhou, about 70km’s ride. </p>
  <p>Not even a challenge, but for Natu who averages about 50km a day, it may be a bit harsh.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We have only ridden for about 5km and Natu has disappeared again. </p>
  <p>Went back to check out on her and I can only laugh, the back tire is flat again. </p>
  <p>Although I thought this would happen from our emergency patch work, but only lasted 5km?!!! </p>
  <p>Natu wanted me to ride on, she will walk to Lanzhou, but I am a bit concerned. </p>
  <p>Natu ‘s visa needs an extension, so she has to get to Lanzhou Public Security Bureau by 2:30pm </p>
  <p>By walking she would never make it in time. I have to help her.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Quick brain storm, if we travel back to Gaoyazhen now and replace the tube, </p>
  <p>it will only solve the problem temporarily as her problem is the inner tire itself. </p>
  <p>If we carry on walking, there are no guarantees there will be a bike repair shop or even a town. </p>
  <p>And now Natu is telling me to ride on, she didn’t want to delay my trip.</p>
  <p>I AM BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Luckily there are still buses passing by and we waved one to stop. </p>
  <p>The bus is full with passengers but the aisle is still empty. </p>
  <p>I asked the conductor to see if she will allow Natu to catch a lift to the nearest bike repair shop or straight to Lanzhou, </p>
  <p>she was reluctant at first but after I pleaded with her and explained that Natu is a foreigner, </p>
  <p>the bike cannot be repaired without tools and we simply cannot leave her wondering on the road, </p>
  <p>she caved and agreed. I tried to catch the bus after it has left, what was I thinking? </p>
  <p>The bus dropped me after the first climb.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Natu , born in Osaka of a Korean descendant, worked at a Bed &amp; Breakfast Hostel in Okinawa,  </p>
  <p>other than “How are you?” and “Thank you”, her Mandarin is as good as my Latin. </p>
  <p>She has barely any living essentials, are loaded with souvenirs she bought along the trip </p>
  <p>and not a single tool to repair the bike. </p>
  <p>Her only water supply is the spring water bottle she spent 1 RMB onbut she has a can opener for beers. </p>
  <p>But she has no fear traveling along.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I admire her courage, but only after the bus left my sight did I remember I did not remind her to be careful. </p>
  <p>It was a coincidence that we met on a remote highway in the middle of China, but I doubt I will see her at Lanzhou. </p>
  <p>“Let’s be one day partners!”, </p>
  <p>I met Natu with when I got lost yesterday and we thought we could make it to Lanzhou in a day together </p>
  <p>since we both are heading there, “Let’s be one day partners!”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looked down at my watch,  this is about the time yesterday I heard the strange accented “How are you ~”. </p>
  <p>Although we did not travel to Lanzhou together, the “let be one day partner!” kinds of ends today. Natu, </p>
  <p>all the best to you, may God bless you!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now then, I can ride on without looking back . </p>
  <p>Had a look at Google Earth last night, the road from Gaoyazhen to Lanzhou are all mountain passes,</p>
  <p> thought it was going to be a hard ride. Oh well, from 2000m above sea level to 1500m above sea level, </p>
  <p>I will just enjoy the “down hill” mountain pass I guess.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010933.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Stopped mid way to buy 2 packets of milk for breakfast, </p>
  <p>gobbled them down with some biscuits and right back on the bike to Lanzhou.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010931.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Took off my gloves during break, after 20 odd days of riding, my fingers now has two tones. </p>
  <p>If I get even lazier and don’t even bother with sun screen, I will have bikini lines on my face.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010934.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Wow, I arrived at Lanzhou just before 12h00, kind of caught me by surprise, </p>
  <p>what am I to do for the rest of the day?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010936.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since I have nothing specific to do, I guess I will follow routine and look for a Hostel. </p>
  <p>I just realized I don’t really enjoy the big cities of China, they are literally all the same, all dull and grey and boring. </p>
  <p>If Xian doesn’t have the old city wall, if Beijing’s street were narrower, </p>
  <p>if Lanzhou is not 1500ft above sea level, I can barely tell the difference. </p>
  <p>They are of the same noise, the same commercial influence and I am still uncomfortable in any of these cities.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010939.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I like small towns and villages. No tall buildings, old and literally broken, but full of flavour. </p>
  <p>Neighbours will sit around street corners and chat, every grocer is a treasure hunt of its own. </p>
  <p>I act like a kid who wants everything when I venture into them. The treats are tasty and the price never scares me. </p>
  <p>Best of all, the people are people still. A smile is rewarded with a smile, you don’t find this kind of humanity in the big cities.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010946.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Gonna ride straight and see what I can find and no surprises, </p>
  <p>found a smallish hostel’s sign amongst waves of signs. </p>
  <p>The weird thing is this, most of the hostels’ reception are all on the 1st floor, some at the 2nd floor. </p>
  <p>Anyway, carried Dido and my bags (close to 50kg) up to the first floor, hardly breathed and the manager is out to greet me. </p>
  <p>I think he has seen many bike travelers like me, barely lifted an eyebrow and greeted me with</p>
  <p> “you heading to Xingjiang or Tibet”?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>How often do you meet someone with this kind of “connection”? </p>
  <p>Since I already planned to stay at Lanzhou for two day I am already keen to stay here. </p>
  <p>The room is pretty decent too. The only problem would be “price”, RMB 35.00 a night. </p>
  <p>Pulled my usual stunt by shaking the head and waved him off (sign of too expensive, I can’t afford it) </p>
  <p>and decided that I am going to stroll the street and see if I can find better.</p>
  <p> It’s early anyway, I can always come back.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The listed price here is “single room at 35 RMB”, “double sharing at 25 RMB”, “three sharing at 20 RMB” and “four sharing at RMB18”. </p>
  <p>Not really keen to worry about my luggage whilst resting or out on the street, </p>
  <p>so I refused the manager’s suggestion of take up shared rooms.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But every turn with Dido, every step I took going out, the manager comes up with one more trick.</p>
  <p> “I will tell you what, 30 RMB for a single room”, I continue to walk. </p>
  <p>“Still not happy? Fine, 25 RMB! 25 RMB has got to be good?”, I put on my sun glasses. </p>
  <p>“OK, OK, 20 RMB. Come on, I can’t be cheaper, just stay.”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Oh my lord! Price cutting in Master’s Degree! </p>
  <p>I don’t even need to put up a dialogue! From RMB 35 to 20 I did not even flip my tongue! </p>
  <p>I am so pleased with myself! The room offers its own tap and basin, </p>
  <p>going to get some washing powder and wash all my clothes (I guess I will hang it out there in my room).</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010955.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Not bad to have sort out accommodation by lunch. </p>
  <p>Talking about lunch I decided to try out the Islamic version of the Beef Noodle Soup. </p>
  <p>Probably because the soup looked a bit light in taste, I asked to add in some extra beef. </p>
  <p>The Restaurant gave me 7 or 8 slices. I am so touched, this looked like the Beef Noodle Soup I remembered from Taipei.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Got myself a Beef Baomo for dessert and started my strolls on the street (strange, Baomos should be eaten at Xian, I am eating it at Lanzhou, </p>
  <p>what am I doing?). Got myself some toilet papers, washing powder (this is damn important!), </p>
  <p>some dried fruits and ice cream popsicle and wondered in the street, hey, University of Lanzhou was next door to where I stay. </p>
  <p>This is China, usually the University with the name of the city is close to the best ones. </p>
  <p>It looked pretty ordinary though. Maybe I will have time to check it out tomorrow. </p>
  <p>Actually, I just don’t know what is there is Lanzhou for me to see.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010950.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Damn, almost forgot about Natu, wonder where the bus took her? </p>
  <p>Did she manage to repair her bike? Did she find Home Affairs to extend her Visa? man, I hope things worked out fine for her.</p>
