  <p class="style5">The wind sang me songs</p>
  <p>After I spend 3 MCY(Chinese dollar) for a map from a newspaper stand. Suddenly, find out there are many places to hang out. </p>
  <p>When I move out from Beijing, I took a long way. Unknowing, I am paddled back to a city by the yellow river again. </p>
  <p>Lanzhou city and yellow river feels like Paris and La Seine. </p>
  <p>They both had a great river running through their city. </p>
  <p>In Paris, you can see all kinds of coffee shop, artist, little shop and tourist by the La Seine river. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010970.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>You can also see a lot of shops in Lanzhou city but, the river side shop was selling beer instead. </p>
  <p>Not too many tourist if compare to La Seine but, there is some very interesting little shops. </p>
  <p>Including someone carrying a scale and gives your weight and height than ask for 50 Chinese cent. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020028.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I try to reach the rail station when I first got this map. </p>
  <p>I was lost, right away. In fact, there are three rail stations over here. </p>
  <p>They are Lanzhou east, Lanzhou and Lanzhou west rail station. I went to the East station which near by. </p>
  <p>But, I can not find any road to pass the rail track. </p>
  <p>So, I follow the locals pushing my bike walking up and down on those little hills of coal, taking my bike walking on the rail road track. </p>
  <p>Finally, I went to the other side of rail track but, where is the station? </p>
  <p>It turn out, this station was only a place for loading cargoes from those factory near by. </p>
  <p>There are so many factories around this area, especially &quot;armory&quot;. </p>
  <p>This rail station is a rail station with out any platform.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The real Lanzhou rail station was sitting along by the hill side. </p>
  <p>It creates a grand view of that station. I start my tour today form here. </p>
  <p>I skip the idea of taking one day visited of Lanzhou University. Because, there are so many university was called Lanzhou University. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010969.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Today's plan is going to visited &quot;the number one bridge&quot; on Yellow river.</p>
  <p>(sounds like it's the first bridge built on Yellow river) </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010986.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is a iron construction which only allow people and bike passing through. </p>
  <p>There are people selling photo service and showing their hand full of pictures as an example. </p>
  <p>You can get away with that by showing your own camera in your hand. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020016.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The other side of Yellow river, I found a park which can let people walk into the water. </p>
  <p>There is a shop keeper tells me that bike is not allow to ride inside when I go in to the park. </p>
  <p>They will take care of my bike if I leave my bike over there. </p>
  <p>I was thinking to myself, how nice of these guy, it turn out that they charge for bike keeping. </p>
  <p>It's only three Chinese cents. Well, never mind! </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020011.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I found a stair way lead me directly go into the river when I go near to the river bank. </p>
  <p>Take off my shoes and socks, stepping in to the cold river water. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010995.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It's more than cold. Actually, it is freezing. </p>
  <p>I can not put my feet in the water over ten seconds, without turning red and hurt like stinging. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020007.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The Yellow river looks clean. Maybe, it's still on the upper part of the river and did not being contaminated by those factories. </p>
  <p>In my life, this is the first time I reach Yellow river. </p>
  <p>Can't believed how freezing the water is and wondering if the fish was frozen under the water. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020002.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After I touch the Yellow river, my first goal was done. </p>
  <p>Now, I'm moving toward to my second goal. &quot;Yellow river beer&quot; 3 Chinese dollars and fifty cents a bottle. </p>
  <p>It's a little too much but, it's OK! There are people playing Chinese chess when I sit down by the river side. </p>
  <p>It's a very interesting game to watch. They are competing with each party's opinion instead of their skill. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020027.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It does not matter who is playing better. But, it seems matter that got bigger cheer squad. </p>
  <p>As I enjoy the game. Suddenly, I cry out &quot;move the knight&quot; and joint the battle. </p>
  <p>It's really interesting. Because you don't have to be responsible to what you said. </p>
  <p>The guy who was playing took all the blame.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lanzhou got their own beer factory which produces lots of beer. </p>
  <p>You can see that everyone keeps drinking. </p>
  <p>It generated a German beer festival's kind of feeling that make you believed the beer was free of charge, but, in fact those beer cost you money. ORZ</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I go to the main street, there is a plaza with over a thousand seats and there are all kinds of food stand. </p>
  <p>Any barbecue food stand was always busy. There are people chatting and some others playing card over that area. </p>
  <p>No matter what they do. One thing for sure, everyone enjoy their beer. </p>
  <p>On the other hand, I feel surprised about those Muslim restaurants around the plaza. </p>
  <p>They can not drink beer. But, they run their restaurant with lots of people drinking. </p>
  <p>Its must be a big trial to their religious code.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Leaving the river side and heading to downtown area. Lanzhou feels no smaller than Taipei. </p>
  <p>According to the map, there are six to seven movie theaters. </p>
  <p>The price of a movie starts from ten to fifteen Chinese dollars. </p>
  <p>Originally, I plan to watch &quot;Spiderman III&quot;. However, considering the translation and they change the voice over into Chinese, </p>
  <p>makes I fall in to an irreconcilable conflict. I really don't like this Mandarin voice over idea~</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lanzhou city was also known as the capital of fruits. </p>
  <p>This city got its reputation of growing all kind of fruits, like water melon, Bailan melon, cherry, peaches, Litchi and all other fruits. </p>
  <p>I start drooling, every time I stand in front of fruit stand. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020091.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>They let try every kind of fruits except big melon. </p>
  <p>The boss says with pride:&quot; How about that? Very sweet, right! All these fruits were grown locally in Lanzhou. </p>
  <p>The best fruits you can find&quot;. It was great but, making me more confused what I want to buy. </p>
  <p>Finally, I decided to buy Bailan melon. They charge five Chinese dollars per kilogram. </p>
  <p>I spend nine Chinese dollars to have two and ask the boss cut one open for me to have it there. </p>
  <p>This melon is slightly bigger than musk melon. It got this oval shape and tasted like Hami melon. </p>
  <p>The meat was harder than Hami melon but, softer than musk melon. Anyway, itâ€™s a sweet and tasty fruit. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I went into the freezing Yellow river water, try the local beer on the river side, tasted the Bailan melon. </p>
  <p>All of my three goals were completed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I came back to the inn and settle down my bicycle.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020029.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> I take a bus to hang-out in Baitar Hill Park. I did not plan to visit this place. </p>
  <p>I did not know its existence before this trip. It was the trip on the bridge over Yellow river. </p>
  <p>I saw this place with many temple style building. Well, you can say that is common in China but, it also very beautiful.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1010989.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> I did do my home work and find out the ticket cost 6 Chinese dollars but, no bikes allow entering. </p>
  <p>It's affordable, so I decided to take a bus and visited this spot. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020037.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On the map of Lanzhou city, there is a brief of Baitar temple. </p>
  <p>It is built along the hill and the temple was located on the top of that hill which is 1700 kilometer above sea level. </p>
  <p>Its 200 meters higher than Lanzhou city, so, you can see the entire Lanzuou city from the hill top. </p>
  <p>I found out the bricks was made from mud when walking on the stairs. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020063.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It's very fragile and you can break it easily if you push hard.  </p>
  <p>80% of the bricks were marks with someone's name.</p>
  <p> It's amazing and also very sad. Every where was marked, even some place in the temple surround with fence. </p>
  <p>Seems that want to leave their name behind. They did not treasure this beautiful place.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Chinese temple got its own style. Usually, you can see animal sculpture carved from jade, lineup on top of the roof and the eaves. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020049.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Baitar temple is small. It looks like the shape of a bowling pin and only 17 meters high. </p>
  <p>It was built in Yuan dynasty, 1228 AC., About 800 years before now. </p>
  <p>This temple was built in memory of a lama. The building had 7 stories and 8 sides with wind chimes. </p>
  <p>It jingles when the breeze went through. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020085.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It's Tuesday when I visit the temple and not much tourist around. </p>
  <p>I only met a gentleman came from NanJing ask me to take a photo of him and the tower, over this quiet afternoon. </p>
  <p>I was sitting down on the stairway, listening to the music play by the breeze. </p>
  <p>I felt very much peaceful to my heart. </p>
  <p>The sounds of wind chimes seem came from the sky or, go in to the deepest part of who is listening. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020075.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NSynpWkvde4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>I walk down from the hill and the wind blowing some unknown leaves and petals all around. </p>
  <p>Some flower still standing there and swinging with the wind. Some flower lost few petals, take away by the wind, high up in the sky. </p>
  <p>Finally, they fall down and joint the carpet of leaves and flowers. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020090.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I stay longer than I expect when visiting this temple on the hill. </p>
  <p>At first, I just want to see the city from a top view but, the beautiful sight and the smooth atmosphere seized me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020058.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As far as I go to north-west, the Sun light stays longer. </p>
  <p>It's been 8 o'clock in the afternoon but, the sky still bright. </p>
  <p>I decided to walk back to my hotel, instead of taking the bus. It might take one hour on foot.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even I am not familiar with Lanzhou city. But, today's trip gives me a wonderful memory of Lanzhou city. </p>
  <p>I feel great that I spend one day hanging around in this city.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Gansu and Lanzhou is very much the same, the city got this long and slim shape.</p>
  <p> I start up from south-east which cities were busy. </p>
  <p>As I go further more into north-west, rainfall disappear quickly. The desert which I am expecting is not far from here~</p>
