  <p class="style5">Hexi Corridor</p>
  <p>After I left Lanzhou, The route became very simple. As long as I get on to the National Highway No. 312, </p>
  <p>I will pass through a series of oasis city: Weiwu, Zhangye, Jiuquan, Jiayuguan, Yumen, Dunhuang and all the way to Urumchi, </p>
  <p>and finally entering Kazakhstan.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I rode in the Hexi Corridor at the part of this road in Gansu,. </p>
  <p>This corridor cut through the mountain, and is part of the famous Silk Road that Zhang Qian took to the west. </p>
  <p>I am kind of excited with the fact that I am on the same road that Mr. Zhang took.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The first thing today is to rode across Lanzhou. It is until now that I know I had only been to a small part of Lanzhou city.</p>
  <p> It took me nearly an hour from where I stay to the city border of Lanzhou. </p>
  <p>The road construction began right outside the city limit, and the condition of the road became so bad that it totally made me mad. </p>
  <p>Even ordinary car was turned into bumpy car in this kind of road condition. </p>
  <p>The road was so bad that I had to walk Dido through this lousy part of road, or Dido might be damaged by the awful road condition.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020096.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even since I entered Gansu, I had been eating beef noodle. </p>
  <p>From the Lanzhou beef noodle to the Qing Zhen (translator note: Qing Zhen means Islamic) beef noodle that allows extra portion of meat,</p>
  <p> I had already lost count on how many meals of beef noodle I had. </p>
  <p>Right before I left Lanzhou, I had another beef noodle as my lunch. With extra meat of course. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the restaurant, I found a teapot placed on my table. </p>
  <p>It has an engraving of two Chinese characters “Qing Zhen” on it. I think to myself “Wow, that is a beautiful teapot, even comes with engraving.” </p>
  <p>I hailed the waiter for a glass, and told him that I want to have a sip of the tea inside this teapot. </p>
  <p>“What? You serious? It is vinegar inside this teapot!”</p>
  <p>Why do they want to put vinegar in beautiful teapot? </p>
  <p>This made me want to dig a hole on the ground and hid in it, since every one in the restaurant now know that I want to drink some vinegar.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020102.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Side with the orange flavored soda which costs 30 cent each and eating the delicious beef noodle, </p>
  <p>I say to myself “Even though this is delicious, maybe its time to find something other than beef noodle to eat.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I stuffed my stomach, applying the sunscreen and resting in the shade of the tree outside, </p>
  <p>a gang of elementary school students who were one their way home surrounded me.</p>
  <p>“How do you do, Uncle?”</p>
  <p>Please call me “Brother” instead…</p>
  <p>“Uncle, this bike is so cool!”</p>
  <p>Would you please kindly address as “Brother”? Please?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020105.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This group of kids would be totally adorable if they know how to address me correctly.</p>
  <p>Okay, now everyone gather here and take a picture with the “Big brother’s” bike.</p>
  <p>One major advantage of the digital camera is you get to see the picture right after you took it. </p>
  <p>I showed the picture to the kids, and every one of them was screaming with excitement. </p>
  <p>Then someone said that they want to take picture with Dido one by one. </p>
  <p>Well, it is not like I have endless time to play with you kids…</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But actually, I do have some time to kill. I talked with these kids and showed them my gears. </p>
  <p>My fingerless biking glove normally shows my finger when I wore it, but when it is on the kids’ hand, their fingers are barely visible.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020106.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A chatty kid who said that my bike helmet looks like a turtle shell says </p>
  <p>“the bike has a head light with it, this is really high standard gear” </p>
  <p>Another sophisticated kid says that they are really happy to meet you, Uncle. </p>
  <p>Hey, please call me “big brother”, or I will play with you guys no more.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After I followed the road westbound to He-kou, the road split into two. </p>
  <p>National highway 109 leads to Qinghai and National highway 312 leads to Xinjiang. </p>
  <p>After I went back to the correct road – I almost went on the road to Qinhai – I went on National highway 312. </p>
  <p>I will have to stick to this road for more than 2000 kilometers, and I wished that the road is in good shape, </p>
  <p>the view alongside it is splendid and few truck travels along it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020116.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is a boiling hot day today. The temperature is around 35 degree Celsius under the sun. </p>
  <p>Thanks for the merchants along the road who supplied me with ice bars so that I can maintain the stamina under this extreme sunlight. </p>
  <p>Whenever I saw someone selling ice bars, I stopped and buy two bars of it. </p>
  <p>I consume one bar while riding and keep the other bar in my jacket pocket, as a mean to cool my body.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My original plan was to eat about 15 bars for today, but when I arrived at the destination for today I had only finished 8 bars. </p>
  <p>If the sun keeps on grilling the ground tomorrow, I will continue my quest of ice bar eating. </p>
  <p>After some time, when I went to the deserted ground, there will not be so many road side merchants around.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding in the Hexi Corridor feels like riding in the East Rift Valley when I was biking around Taiwan. </p>
  <p>The corridor is not a narrow place, but with the mountain alongside it, this corridor is the only place you can find greenness. </p>
  <p>I don’t know why the mountains are so bald, not even a little grass on it. </p>
  <p>But the naked mountain creates a good contrast and makes the corridor more green and beautiful.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020134.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In the distance you can see some thing looks like paddy field.</p>
  <p> (cut the crap, how do you get paddy field in such a dry place). </p>
  <p>After I took a close look, those illusion of water in the field comes from the reflections of the plastic sheet they put on top of the field. </p>
  <p>The farmers here had to put these plastic cover on the ground to keep the water from evaporating, or their crops will dry out and die.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020136.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I rode to “four of a kind” on the national highway 312, I found out that the highway has a twin brother!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020124.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>One of them is newly built, and the other one is the old highway. </p>
  <p>The sign on the new highway listed all the cities I plan to go along the way and looks very promising. </p>
  <p>I am a little bit hesitated in which road to take. </p>
  <p>Later today I talked with the owner of the hotel about this problem, </p>
  <p>and he said that the new road is like a closed highway with few exits and no access to store or villages. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020125.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Isn’t this the replica of the other road I had been on before? </p>
  <p>Two highway exits for the whole day, one for lunch and one for lodging? </p>
  <p>It is totally boring to ride on this kind of road. Thanks for that information, I decided to go on the old 312 highway.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I feel a bit of hungry around 4:30 PM. Since it is hot outside, I want to have some cold noodle. </p>
  <p>But even though the cook knows how to make it, they are out of cold noodle. I end up ordered a dry noodle with sauce.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I slowly found out that these “general terms” of the dishes are merely an abstract idea of the food. </p>
  <p>The dish may come in the same name, but each cook makes it differently. </p>
  <p>Not only different in the taste but also the ingredients. </p>
  <p>Take the dry noodle with sauce as an example. This is totally a dish of vegetable noodle!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But thanks to the vegelized dry noodle with sauce, I have a lot of delicious vegetables today. </p>
  <p>I have been eating few vegetables lately. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020128.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After the early dinner, it is only one hour on bike before I arrive at the stop for tonight. </p>
  <p>I know nothing about this town Yongdeng, all I know about it is I will spend a night here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020138.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I was trying to find the Hotel in town, I saw a hotel show their prices of the room below the sign. </p>
  <p>That is a good gesture, since this way you will not be overcharged so easily. </p>
  <p>I looked at the price and start to think of how much I am willing to spend on lodging now. </p>
  <p>If I saw this price at the first day of my journey, I will be yelling “It’s so cheap! This is totally cheap! Totally affordable!”</p>
  <p>But now I do not think so. The hotel staff opens the window and tell me to get in, and I wave goodbye to him.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020141.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then I found a hotel charge me for 10 bucks, since the staff is friendly and the price is good, I stayed at that hotel. </p>
  <p>However, after I checked in I found out that it is a room for three, </p>
  <p>and there is already a guy checked in who travels with motorcycle and work along the way. Well, </p>
  <p>it is going to be another night of sleep with all my luggage on the bed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020144.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The guy who travels on motorcycle tells me how it is like on the road to Weiwu, which is my destination tomorrow. </p>
  <p>(He rode his motorcycle from Zhangye to here today, and that is a three day ride for me on bicycle.) </p>
  <p>Tomorrow I will have to pass through Wuqiaoling mountain, altitude around 2700 meters above sea level. </p>
  <p>This means I will have to climb for around 1000 meter in height tomorrow. </p>
  <p>The guy says that the slope is quite steep, and I might have to walk my bike. </p>
  <p>The good news is that the slope is not too long at a little more than 4 kilometers.. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The hotel owner also lives at this hotel. When I was washing my clothes with the icy cold water, I suddenly felt the urge to gulp the water. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020146.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Resisting the urge, I asked the owner to see if it is safe to drink this water. </p>
  <p>The owner replies that this is tap water and it is safe to drink. </p>
  <p>If he told me that this water is from the well or natural spring, I would have gulp it without concern. </p>
  <p>But if this is tap water… that’s another story…</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since I have already passed my beef noodle phase, I ordered slice noodle with boned pork chop. </p>
  <p>I thought it will be served on a single dish, however the sliced noodle and the boned pork comes in separate dishes. </p>
  <p>The pork is chopped in small piece and stewed, it is not oily and the meat separate from the bone easily. </p>
  <p>Sprinkled with the freshly sliced shallots, the sweet and slightly spicy taste goes very well with the delicious pork chops.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020148.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This restaurant seems quite famous in the neighborhood and the place is full of guests. </p>
  <p>Most table ordered several pounds of pork chop. </p>
  <p>Since I am all by myself, I only ordered half a pound of the pork chop to fill my desire of food. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Compared to the excellent pork, the sliced noodle does not stand out at all. </p>
  <p>It was like a normal sliced noodle inside something tastes like sour and spicy soup.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>With my stomach full of food, I walked back to the hotel and saw the hotel owner was playing some kind of card game with the guests. </p>
  <p>I thought that they must be playing something that I have never heard of, but their conversation caught my attention.</p>
  <p>“Shit! I don’t even have a two.”</p>
  <p>“Single three, I will deal single five.”</p>
  <p>They are playing the Big Two! I know how to play this!</p>
  <p> (Note from the translator: Big Two is a very popular card game in SE Asia. </p>
  <p>The rule is a little bit similar to President, but instead of Ace, Two ranked highest in game.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I was about to enter the game, I found out that the rule they followed is not that familiar to me… </p>
  <p>“Why can’t I use a single card instead of a pair with three of a kind to form a full house? </p>
  <p>The rule is not at all flexible.”</p>
  <p>“Three to eight!” Hum, sound likes he had a hand of straight.</p>
  <p>Hold on!</p>
  <p>Three to eight???</p>
  <p>Why is it three to eight? This means 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Six card in one hand?</p>
  <p>Do not laugh at this yet. This “three to eight” skips six in the straight!</p>
  <p>But the guy still deals the hand without any hesitation, and no one complains. </p>
  <p>It was like they are following their rule perfectly.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was tempted to go out my room and join the game, </p>
  <p>but listening to their conversation during the game and trying not to laughing out loud made my stomach hurt.</p>
  <p>They are even betting in this totally chaotic game. Loser pays 50 cents to winner each game.</p>
  <p>I originally thought that I should be able to earn some money for ice bar with my experience in “Big Two”, </p>
  <p>but with this chaotic rule, I may end up losing my pants.</p>
