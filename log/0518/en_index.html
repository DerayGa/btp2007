  <p class="style5">37 degree Celsius</p>
  <p>Long day yesterday! I was totally worn out after finishing the text part of the trip log, </p>
  <p>and then fell asleep immediately. The photos were added to the log this morning, </p>
  <p>so I did not hit the road till 8:30am. To me, Wuwei was just a place I slept over.</p>
  <p>For your information, the average amount of time I spend on a trip log is 2 to 3 hours.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On the way out of Wuwei, I had eight-treasure porridge and two tasty deep-fried Chinese doughnuts for breakfast. </p>
  <p>The porridge was not sweet, but I could sugar it as much as I liked to make it yummy. The solid doughnuts filled me up.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020301.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Today’s weather was opposite of yesterday’s. Yesterday I had a terrible headwind, but mild sun. </p>
  <p>Today, the temperature rose to 30 degree Celsius in the early morning. </p>
  <p>However the wind became gentle breeze at my back and pushed me forward slowly.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020316.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I did not feel quite up to snuff today, probably because of the gentle uphill from Wuwei to Zhangye. </p>
  <p>The uphill road seemed flat, but it was quite difficult to ride, </p>
  <p>which gave me an illusion that I could not even speed up on a flat road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020307.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So, it was quite pleasing to hide from the baking hot sun for lunch at noon. </p>
  <p>While waiting for my stir-fry noodle, </p>
  <p>I was bored and started counting the chickens in the yard, totalling 13 of them (two were white).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I only paid five RMB for stir-fry noodles and egg soup. </p>
  <p>The soup was “customer-made”, because the locals just drank noodle water.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020314.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The sun was high and shining. I watched TV news at the hotel before set off this morning. </p>
  <p>It said today’s temperature would be about 35 degree Celsius, and the humidity was only 10%. </p>
  <p>I guessed I should expect very dry weather.</p>
  <p>A lunch followed by an ice pop was the best way to beat the summer heat. </p>
  <p>I became an ice pop expert after having so many ice pops. </p>
  <p>Some products were super yucky, such as ice cream sticks. </p>
  <p>They tasted like vesicant, totally gross. Therefore, I stuck to the ice pop series. </p>
  <p>Iced colored sugar water - how bad could it be?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The scenery was dull along the way, and so was the ride. </p>
  <p>Not even a trivial event like “my hat got blown away” happened. </p>
  <p>If nothing interesting happened, how can I write an entertaining trip log? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020318.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>At the railroad crossing where no gate existed, freight trains always slow down and blast their horn to alert motorists.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020304.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Yongchang was a larger city along the way where I took a picture of the statues.</p>
  <p>“Aren’t they Zhang Qian, the imperial envoy of the Han Dynasty, and his foreign friends?”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020323.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When the temperature hit 37 degree Celsius around 2:00 or 3:00pm, the road started melting in the heat. </p>
  <p>A pickup truck and two road workers spread gravel on the melting road. When cars went by, </p>
  <p>they rolled the gravel into the tar. Therefore, the tar won’t coat the tires. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020329.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was 240 km from Wuwei to Zhangye. </p>
  <p>My plan was to make it a two day ride, 120 km per day. </p>
  <p>It was 5:30pm already, very tedious the whole day today. </p>
  <p>I just had to ride another 10km before finding a place to sleep. </p>
  <p>When I was going to call it a day, I got lost. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020342.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Route 312 became a road under construction with a detour sign “Road Under Construction, Please Detour”. </p>
  <p>There was another road for traffic beside it. I did not want to have a detour because I was quite ready to stop.</p>
  <p>I asked a road worker if I could ride on the road under construction, </p>
  <p>he said “Yes, but be careful”. I thought I saved the annoyance of detour and got back on Route 312. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020354.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The truth was the road under construction was a local road, Z59 or something. </p>
  <p>The road beside it was THE Route 312. I was not aware of it till I had finished the 6 km construction site. </p>
  <p>I was reluctant to ride back on the lousy road, so I kept riding. Hopefully, </p>
  <p>this local road could take me back to Route 312 – Please! Please!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020351.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The scenery along the local road became lovely and was much better than the main roads. </p>
  <p>Riding on a local road is a bit of treat.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My hat got blown off into the river by the gust of wind and swept away by the water which caused a small ripple in an ordinary day. </p>
  <p>I felt sorry for my hat. Even though it was a cheap five-RMB hat, it blocked the afternoon sun for me. </p>
  <p>I had no idea what to do without it. Maybe look for a similar one in the next major city. </p>
  <p>Along the way, I could also buy a scarf to cover up my face.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020358.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As long as I could find a hotel to stay overnight at the midpoint of the two days trip, </p>
  <p>I would be on track. Just in case I did not find a place to stay before 8:00pm, I would camp here tonight.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I started seeing strange mud walls, about 30 meters in length and 5 meter in width, </p>
  <p>covered with straw mats with two doors on each side. Some mats were unfolded to let the sunlight in. </p>
  <p>Was it a sheep pen? Beats me!!!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020363.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It started cooling down after 5:00pm. During the day, </p>
  <p>even though I put on gloves and long bike pants, </p>
  <p>I was burned by the sun. I even smelled scorched to myself.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020369.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And then, a few dirt houses, like the ruin of Pompeii, appeared. People did live in these houses.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020375.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And then, a few dirt houses, like the ruin of Pompeii, appeared. People did live in these houses.</p>
  <p>I asked “Where and how far can I find a place to eat and sleep?”</p>
  <p>The local person said “Hongshanyao at the foothill” [Note: Yao in Chinese means kiln]. </p>
  <p>The name reflects the area where there were many cute traditional kilns. </p>
  <p>I wondered what kind of earthenware was fired here. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At around 7:30pm, I rode back to a place with signboards and shops, a small bustling town.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020377.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I found a newly opened restaurant with firecracker paper still on the ground where I could also sleep over.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020382.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> Because the room was cheap, ten RMB for one night, I could spare some money for good food. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020387.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had scallion scrambled egg, pork in garlic sauce, and noodles for dinner. </p>
  <p>The restaurant did not make any soup. To quench my thirst, I had a soda and a juice.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020393.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> After taking with my order, the store owner went to a market and brought back a bunch of scallion and a box of eggs. </p>
  <p>Wow! Food here was not only freshly cooked but also freshly bought. </p>
  <p>I got some good news at dinner that I could get back to Route 312 from Hongshanyao, the town I did not expect to visit.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Too lazy to shower, I would clean up myself in Zhangye tomorrow, a major oasis city.</p>
