  <p class="style5">Desert? What desert?</p>
  <p>Just like yesterday, the sky looks as grey as ever in all directions. Perfect for riding. </p>
  <p>The harsh sun is no way to be found and blocked by the dust.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020640.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Breakfast today is the leftovers from yesterday’s picnic, Biscuits, chips and peanut butter milk. </p>
  <p>I am having a picnic on my bike, reckon by the time I am full I would have finished half of my snacks. </p>
  <p>As expected, the minute I left Gaotai it’s uphill and it comes with a strong face wind. </p>
  <p>Uphill is already a battle, the wind is like a knife in my back. I am riding like a turtle, averaging 10km/h. </p>
  <p>the toilet rolls are flying like flags in the wind. Hey, I could fly them just like a kite.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020564.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I guess the face wind has its virtues, since it is so hard pushing the pedals, </p>
  <p>I am not so sure whether it was because of the wind or the hill, so I am blaming the wind and purposely forgetting about the hill. </p>
  <p>Oh well, climbed another few hundred meters above sea level.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020584.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Ever since entering the province of Gansu, I have been expecting deserts, only today did I notice I have already rode pass a few. </p>
  <p>But these deserts are not what I envisioned. I have always thought deserts are with sand hills, cactus and camels running around. </p>
  <p>The deserts I am passing now are more like mud hills, not a single cactus and I have sheeps instead of camels.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>These green vegetations when dried, becomes little dry brown grass balls, rolling all over the desert.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020567.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>man, the Gansu deserts are not what I imagines. </p>
  <p>I guess I need to get to Xinjiang to see my deserts?</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The distance between towns and villages are getting longer and obviously more risky. </p>
  <p>The 40km uphill I rode after leaving Gaotai are all desert areas. </p>
  <p>The sky is dusty and the weather warm, but I am only seeing desert plains everywhere. </p>
  <p>Only after another 40km did I see people on the road. This is what it feels like in deserted areas. </p>
  <p>The more I travel toward the Northwest, the more I am feeling it. I better check my rations, </p>
  <p>it has to at least allow me to travel in this condition for a day to be safe.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020648.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I arrived at a little village nmed Yuensanze around lunch, yeah!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020586.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Ordered a noodle dish I never tried before and ran to the grocer for ice popsicles. </p>
  <p>It took them half an hour to serve the noodle, is the dish that difficult to prepare? </p>
  <p>The meat slices looked burnt, but burnt meat slices taste decent.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020590.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>gave the empty plate back to the waitress after I cleaned off the plates and took me literally seconds before I dozed off on the table. </p>
  <p>I was watching “Prison Break” last night and you just have to know what happens next, damn. </p>
  <p>Anyway, woke up with a hunger, I guess I will have a cold noodle dish. </p>
  <p>Hang on, let me grab another ice popsicle before the dish is served.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020591.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>whilst having lunch, a truck driver was also here for lunch, asked him about the road ahead and got good news. </p>
  <p>From here onward the road is flat and turns downhill all the way to Jiuquan, yes, easy ride ahead. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I am having this lazy, eat &amp; sleep some more feeling, s dozed off until 13h30. </p>
  <p>I guess I better get on the road. Since I scheduled to only arrive at Jiuquan tomorrow, </p>
  <p>but the down hill ride ahead may just get me there tonight. </p>
  <p>The next on the schedule is Jiuquan to Jiayuguan, 30 km, </p>
  <p>if I ride off at 07h00 in the morning I could get there by 09h00 and start looking for a hostel. </p>
  <p>Sounds stupid, kind of feeling like I am wasting money on accommodation and I am not exactly getting a day off. </p>
  <p>I think I will look for a plce to stay the night about 20km off Jiuquan then ride past it tomorrow and stay the night at Jiayuguan. </p>
  <p>This way I can tour the Great Wall and take a day or two off.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Had a bit of rain on the way, well, small drop “almost rain” rain. </p>
  <p>Didn’t even bother with the rain coat and it didn’t last long either. </p>
  <p>Since the sky is dusty, the dried rain drops left mud spots on my sun glasses.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020618.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Left the National Road and try to ride in the sand, I reckon my tires will probably get stuck in it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020626.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Guess not, the desert is harder than tar, actually a better ride. </p>
  <p>Maybe if I had enough provisions I will “bravely” ride into the desert.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020638.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since all the trucks are on the new highway, the National road is mine again. </p>
  <p>The sceneries are nothing but sand and stones with a bit of green weeds extending toward the horizon, over and over.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020597.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am sure you have seen people carrying people on their back, I am now watching trucks on tucks passing by. </p>
  <p>This is nothing, I have seen stranger things, just not fast enough to get my camera out.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020643.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>To prevent the desert covering the roads, the municipality grew trees along side the road. </p>
  <p>But it seems they just plant them and leave them. Barely looking like a tree. </p>
  <p>Since it is planted in sand, I wonder how long it will last.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020625.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Water is scarce, river beds tens of meters wide has only streams of water running.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020615.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Passing some old buildings on the way, although we are at the 21st century, </p>
  <p>the people in these deserted areas are still living by the memories passed down to them. </p>
  <p>Unlike the people in the city who claims creativity to disguise destruction and continues to build over history, </p>
  <p>here, history is a way of live.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020611.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Almost done with the mountains and are seeing greens again. </p>
  <p>Couple of mud brick house on the side of the road, just wondering, these mud brick lasts because of no rain?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020609.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020617.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Gonna have to start looking for my accommodation for the night. I am still 40km away from Jiuquan, </p>
  <p>any hostels within would be fine by me. I guess I won’t make it to Jiuquan anyway, </p>
  <p>not only I am rather tired, it’s not economical. I think I will rest early and ride tomorrow. </p>
  <p>Riding amongst students riding home after school, I guess no one notices I am not local. XD</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020656.jpg" width="900" height="506" /> </p>
  <p>How’s this for a new business idea, a shop that offers hotel, internet café, barbeque and lotto all together.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020666.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And they all in business! Not just signs! The price for accommodation is fair, 20RMB for a double room. </p>
  <p>I just couldn’t figure out what this building was used for before, my room had a sign, “Store Room”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020664.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The manageress is busy tending to lotto ticket customers so had no time for me. </p>
  <p>The lotto tickets in China is rather cheap. It will cost me 50 NT$ in Taiwan, here it is 0.50c, equivalent of 3 NT$.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After I paid for my accommodation I went strolling the streets in my white &amp; blue striped slops and my beach short looking for diner. </p>
  <p>Had Sweet Bean Sauce Noodle and watching the news whilst at it, </p>
  <p>apparently one more month China will be harvesting wheat.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020667.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The sad thing though is that quite a few areas in China are desperate for rain. </p>
  <p>Some area hasn’t had rain for 2 months. It is estimated the harvest will be about 40% short then expected. </p>
  <p>Since the news mentioned drought, I just realized I have been riding in China for a while now and I have only encountered one rainy day.</p>
  <p> I wonder if this drought has anything to do with global warming. Honestly, </p>
  <p>we really need to start doing something for mother earth who has only provided for us. </p>
  <p>The way it’s going, our children won’t have a place to live.</p>
