  <p class="style5">Overhanging Great Wall</p>
  <p>Last night, I checked into the hotel and thought I was going to stay for one night only.</p>
  <p>This morning, I saw the weather was so nice, so I started to plan a trip to the Great Wall of China.</p>
  <p>The hotel owner asked, &quot;You are going to stay here one more night, right?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Huh? I am, but how do YOU know?&quot; I asked myself.</p>
  <p>He reminded me that it would be a windy day, up to Force 7, so I might have trouble riding a bike today.</p>
  <p>I just realized that too sunny, too rainy, now even too windy, are all the factors I should consider when riding a bike.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020735.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I went outside, WOW! It was REALLY windy. </p>
  <p>The boy in &quot;The education of a little tree&quot; said that when he was young, he was so light that he could fly with the wind.</p>
  <p>Judging from this windy situation, I believed with a piece of bed sheet, I can also fly with the wind.</p>
  <p>Anyway, the first thing I needed to do today was not to &quot;eat&quot;, but to check my website situation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Without proper notice or explanation, Bluehost closed my website, and canceled my domain name. </p>
  <p>They just asked me to contact the customer service department via e-mail.</p>
  <p>I couldn't even log into my account. So I registered a new account and demanded an explanation at this internet café.</p>
  <p>What I got was auto-reply from Bluehost saying that someone will look into my account during normal business hour.</p>
  <p>I was so angry and frustrated about their attitude. I pre-paid three years' service fee, for almost 6000 NTD, and this was what I got? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Finally, I received their reply the next morning, which made me even more frustrated. </p>
  <p>First of all, they should write me an e-mail or notify me about any abnormal activities of my account. </p>
  <p>They shouldn't just shut my web site off, stopped my account and expected me to find an alternative way to contact them.</p>
  <p>Basically, they closed my web site because somebody reported illegal activities on my website.</p>
  <p>This answer only confused me even more, and I had no idea what they were talking about.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Good news was, they replied my e-mail within 30 min, saying that those Mac Chinese softwares were illegal, </p>
  <p>and that was the reason they decided to shut off my web site immediately—meaning without notification.</p>
  <p>Well, I had no idea why they were OK before, but now was not, about my Chinese Mac downloads. </p>
  <p>I had no energy to fight with them at this moment, so I just took all the downloads off the site at this moment.  </p>
  <p>Let me say sorry to those Mac users that might need these softwares. I would make them available once I find a new home for them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Enough of the hassles, it was about time for lunch.</p>
  <p>I ordered a beef casserole, and a piece of flatbread.</p>
  <p>The casserole dish had shredded seaweed, some mushrooms, vegetables, cellophane noodles, </p>
  <p>and sliced stewed beef, accompanied with a delectable soup.</p>
  <p>Even I saw some sand-like stuff at the bottom of that pot, I still couldn't control myself but finished the very last drop of that soup.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020740.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The plan for this afternoon? </p>
  <p>&quot;I am going to the Great Wall of China!&quot; Oh! Yeah!</p>
  <p>Carrying two packs of crackers, one pack of peanuts, Dido and I started our field trip together.</p>
  <p>It cost 5 RMB to buy a map, very expensive to me, so I decided to take advantage of my own mouth—ask for directions.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020748.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As usual, I got lost a little bit, but eventually I arrived at the Jiayuguan (Jiayu Pass)—</p>
  <p>also called the &quot; First and Greatest Pass Under Heaven&quot;.</p>
  <p>As everybody knows, Jiayuguan is the west end of the Great Wall, </p>
  <p>so it was always heavily guarded by the military since the ancient China, </p>
  <p>to prevent the attack by Xiongnu (some nomadic people from central Asia in ancient China).</p>
  <p>Many years later, you can still see military units here.</p>
  <p>I saw many tanks running in the desert when I was riding my bike on the way here.</p>
  <p>These soldiers were running under the sun. I wonder where they were heading.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020891.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because the entrance fee for Jiangyu Guan was 61 RMB, and it was rated 4-star, I had no interest whatsoever to get in. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020759.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Remembered that I paid 30 RMB to enter a 4-star tourist site nearby the Yellow River? </p>
  <p>That was totally waste of my money.</p>
  <p>More importantly, bike was not allowed here. </p>
  <p>But I can't park Dido at the parking lot, which was 5 cents, since I didn't bring the lock with me, either.</p>
  <p>Therefore…. </p>
  <p>Yes, I have been at the &quot;First and Greatest Pass Under Heaven&quot;……'s gate.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020761.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I leaned on the fence, and looked inside, &quot;Ohhh.. THAT is the Great Wall&quot;.</p>
  <p>I was still debating if I should pay the money and get in, </p>
  <p>I was wondering if I will regret later that I was so close to the Great Wall but didn't get close enough to walk on it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020769.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I needed time to rethink this over, so I walked and walked, and I walked into the Black Mountain (Hei Shan) Rock painting area.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020781.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Looking at these strange rocks, some were human sculptures marked with years they were made. Some had drawings on them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020811.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There was a Great Wall-styled shopping mall around this park. </p>
  <p>Me? Of course just window shopping.  </p>
  <p>All I could think at this moment was, should I or should I not pay that stupid money and get on the Great Wall.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020814.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just when I started to have serious headache coming, I saw a map, saying &quot;Overhanging Great Wall&quot;.  </p>
  <p>Wow!  Even the name sounds so cool. With an ice popsicle in my mouth, I rushed over on my Dido.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020829.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&quot;Overhanging Great Wall&quot; is also A Great Wall, but the entrance fee was only 21 RMB, which was 40 RMB cheaper than the previous one.  </p>
  <p>The whole package was just too attractive to me.</p>
  <p>The cashier even offered to keep an eye on my Dido while I toured the Great Wall. I was really touched.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020831.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Today is Wed, no tour bus brought in tons of people here. </p>
  <p>This part of Great Wall was smaller, and didn't have the shopping center, so actually not many locals visiting, either.</p>
  <p>I started to walk on the wall around 1:30, and looped back at 3:00, and I WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE WALL. </p>
  <p>This was the best tour I have ever had.  It felt like being those rich people, who spent lots of money to reserve this part of Great Wall just for them.  </p>
  <p>Now with only 21 RMB, I also had this part of Great Wall all by myself.</p>
  <p>I was totally thrilled.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020845.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This was the view from the bottom, and you will pass two beacons when climbing up.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020853.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I started slow (need to catch my breathe), and still not on the top yet ~_~</p>
  <p>I was told that there were two foreigners spent almost six months to walk on the entire Great Wall, 5000 km long.  </p>
  <p>They are really some tough people.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020861.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The recovery of the Great Wall was a delicate and difficult job.  But it was so nicely done, </p>
  <p>that you get to step on the same material that was used thousand years ago to build this Great Wall.</p>
  <p>Even the poles for the flags were made of thin bamboo stick. Their effort to recover this piece of history deeply touched my heart.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020877.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Walk slowly, I saw another &quot;piece&quot; of the Great Wall. For some reason, the Great Wall is not a continuous long wall anymore, </p>
  <p>it was a piece here, and another piece there.  Same for the entrance ticket, </p>
  <p>you have to buy one for each piece of the Great Wall that you want to visit.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020876.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was pretty windy on the ground, and it was worse when I got on this Great Wall. </p>
  <p>The higher I climbed, the stronger the wind was.  </p>
  <p>I might be able to fly like a kite if some one just gave me a bed sheet now.</p>
  <p>Finally, I reached the highest beacon at the Overhanging Great Wall, and this was the end point for this part of the Great Wall. </p>
  <p>After this, was the Great Wall made by the Mother Nature.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020873.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Hou WenYong, a popular author in Taiwan, once said &quot;We see challenge, we march there&quot;.</p>
  <p>With the same attitude, I risked my life to climb down the beacon to the other side, the &quot;Mother Nature Great Wall&quot;. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020883.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Looked at the path I just walked, WOW! And don't forget that I still needed to make it back to the beacon.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020886.jpg" width="900" height="506" /> </p>
  <p>Since I took the dangerous path to come here, might as well take a photo to mark this historical moment.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020888.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Looked down from the beacon, the greens below my feet really were like the oasis in a colossal desert area.</p>
  <p>The trees lined up at each side of the road around here now looked like green lines that extended to the city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020889.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The same analogy, these modern cities like Weiwu, Changyi, Jiuquan, and Jiayuguan, </p>
  <p>were also like oasis cities that surround the desert.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020875.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The views of looking up to the Great Wall from the bottom, </p>
  <p>and looking down to the oasis from the Great Wall, were so dramatically different. </p>
  <p>Embracing the cold breeze on this sunny day, </p>
  <p>I was wondering what those soldiers saw when they were defending their country in the ancient China. </p>
  <p>Was the night cold? It can't be an easy job to take the night shift in the army, </p>
  <p>no matter which dynasty they lived in, right?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I sat here to enjoy the scenery for a long time.</p>
  <p>The purpose of building the Great Wall was to protect China from the attack by Xiongnu, therefore, </p>
  <p>it made a better sense to build the wall along the existing mountains. </p>
  <p>That is why many parts of the Great Wall were sort of blended into the mountains around them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020868.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was a bit hungry on the way back to the city, </p>
  <p>so I was really excited to see the interesting deep-fried chicken stand that I tried yesterday. </p>
  <p>I got some veggie-roll, hot dogs, fish balls, stinky tofu, regular tofu--all on the sticks, </p>
  <p>and the golden needle mushroom that was in my mouth at this moment.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020894.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Their sauce and seasoning powers were really tasty, I could smell it long before I can see that stand.</p>
  <p>It only cost me 4 RMB for all these. I was so happy to eat them on my bike thatI didn't notice I dropped something on the stand . </p>
  <p>(Hint: there was a black little stuff on the upper right hand corner).</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020893.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>By time I was back to the hotel, changed the clothes and ready to sort my photos, I finally noticed that I can't find my GPS tracker. </p>
  <p>It was not on my left hand, where I usually held it that way, it was not in my pocket. So where was it?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The last time I saw that GPS tracker was by that food stand. </p>
  <p>I had to take the photo and eat the food at the same time, so I left my GPS tracker on that stand. </p>
  <p>Then I just left, with my food, but not that tracker.</p>
  <p>Oh! My god! It has been more than half an hour already. </p>
  <p>Still wearing my PJs and slippers, I rode Dido back to that stand as fast as I can.</p>
  <p>I hope nobody would take it, otherwise I won't be able to track my path.</p>
  <p>Usually I turn it on in the morning, turn it off when I arrive to a hotel at night. </p>
  <p>I never pay much attention to it, but it was always doing its job without any complain. </p>
  <p>&quot;I am so sorry for leaving you out there. Please stay at the same place.  I am coming for you ASAP&quot;.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was around 50 m away from that stand, the unique smell told me that I was almost there.  </p>
  <p>I almost cried when I didn't see my GPS tracker on the stand. </p>
  <p>The lady took it out from her cart and told me that she it was too late to grab me back when she saw that on her stand.  </p>
  <p>So she moved it inside her cart to keep it safe.</p>
  <p>&quot;Thank you so much, nice lady! I really appreciate it&quot; </p>
  <p>I thanked her so many times that made her feel a bit embarrassed, so I thought I should go then.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My hat was blown away, so I had to find another hat that can shade the sun when necessary.</p>
  <p>The hotel I stayed was probably on the most crowded street in Jiayuguan city.  </p>
  <p>The traditional market and breakfast stands started their business in the morning, other food stands came in around noon. </p>
  <p>Grocery shopping stalls joined in the afternoon.  </p>
  <p>Then the restaurants and night markets replaced all other activities to occupy the entire street.</p>
  <p>I saw a jean-material baseball cap, maybe this would work just fine for me.</p>
  <p>It was 5 RMB, but I bargained it down to 4, excellent price.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020895.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was still pretty bright at 8:00 at night, but it can't fool my tummy. </p>
  <p>So I went to hunt for dinner at &quot;the most crowded street of Jiayuguan&quot;</p>
  <p>Because most of them sold the same type of food: beef in the clay pot, lamb in the clay pot, </p>
  <p>or chicken in the clay pot, with the same price, 6 RMB. The only difference would be the taste.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020909.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I sat down in a relatively clean restaurant (actually I judged by how the boss looks like), </p>
  <p>and ordered a chicken in the clay pot. The sizzling hot pot was heated on the coal until it's ready.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020902.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After serving on the table, the clay pot continued the soup boiling for a while.</p>
  <p> Adding some meshed garlic paste and hot pepper, accompanied by free flatbread,</p>
  <p> this one tasted way better than the one I had for lunch today.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020906.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I will be out of Jiayuguan tomorrow, that means less grocery stores and less food stands.</p>
  <p> I had to stock my snacks, so I went shopping at the same store I went yesterday.</p>
  <p>I knew I will miss all the convenient stores, restaurants, hotels and ice-pop stands. </p>
  <p>I would have to adjust my life without them.</p>
  <p>I liked peanuts, so I bought 5 packs of different flavors of sweet peanuts, it should last for a while.</p>
  <p>I also got some maltose-sweetened milk, a roll of tissue, </p>
  <p>and a Sachima (Note: a Manchu sweet snack, main ingredient is flour, butter and rock sugar).</p>
  <p>When I was at the cashier, the owner said to me very seriously, </p>
  <p>&quot;I have to remind you that there are a lot of thieves at this area. You'd better take very good care of your personal belongs.&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So, the most crowded street also has the most crowded thieves?</p>
  <p>They'd take anything, from wallets to scooters, and they ran away, beyond, out of the Great Wall. What can you do then?</p>
  <p>&quot;How about the police? Can they do something about it?&quot;</p>
  <p>She gave me a smile, and said those polices were all bribed, </p>
  <p>so don't expect much. We can only take good care of ourselves.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1020911.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since then, I only had enough money and a notebook (not the laptop) with me if I came out for dinners and stuff.  </p>
  <p>That's why I didn't have many photos taken at the dinner place or at night.</p>
  <p>I remembered earlier when I carelessly took out my digital camera while waiting for the dinner. </p>
  <p>That might qualify me as an easy target for &quot;them&quot;, how dangerous!</p>
  <p>I was pretty lucky, I guess, except the adventure to get my GPS tracker back.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Thinking about tomorrow, I am going outside of the Great Wal</p>
  <p>l (in ancient China, it meant you go out of the civilized Chinese area that was governed by the emperor).</p>
  <p> I was very excited and very nervous.</p>
  <p>Indulge me!  Show me what the real desert is! </p>
