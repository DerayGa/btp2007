  <p class="style5">Camping with 1200 sheep</p>
  <p>In the morning, I set off at 8 o’clock sharp. </p>
  <p>By then the sun had become fiercely bright after sunrise. It would be a long day today</p>
  <p>I returned to the hotel to get back the room deposit (five RMB) after riding my bike 500 meters. </p>
  <p>I might have hesitated to go back for only five RMB if I had gone further.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030053.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>My plan was to ride 135 km from Yumeng to Anxi in one day. </p>
  <p>Today’s head wind slowed me down significantly.</p>
  <p>If I made it today, I would get into Anxi around 8:00 or 9:00PM. Making it a two day trip would have been easier.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030055.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was so happy to see the Route 312 re-appeared in Yumeng, which was a good sign that I might ride to Anxi without a detour.</p>
  <p>One and half hours later, after 26 km ride, Route 312 was going to vanish again, which upset me, even though I had expected it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030063.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While I still had the chance to get on the highway, I found an open hole in the fence where I could lift Dido up to the highway. </p>
  <p>Carrying Dido up to the highway was very difficult because the stairs covered with gravel and sand were very slippery. </p>
  <p>The difficulty was greater if I carried my bags and Dido all together at the same time. </p>
  <p>I had to be extremely careful. I was out of breath when climbing up to the Lianhuo highway.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030065.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Blazing hot sun, strong head wind, and straight highway were exactly the same as yesterday, déjà vu! </p>
  <p>The highway divided the vast desert. The tiny clouds could not hide the sun at all. </p>
  <p>I was under the burning sun in such an arid place with no sight of trees what so ever for the entire day.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030110.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I bought 3 sticks of super thick hot dogs, 2 bags of dried beancurd, </p>
  <p>one bag of dried fruit and one stick of sweet sesame twist in the local store for breakfast. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030057.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>All the way till noon, no store, no people, and no gas stations, </p>
  <p>finally I spotted a rest area which was under construction, and the business was not yet started. </p>
  <p>I opened up a bag of peanuts when I failed to overcome my hunger. </p>
  <p>I could not ride without energy, however. I only had snacks for breakfast and lunch.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Food was easier to manage, but water was a problem.  </p>
  <p>I usually got my water supply at where I ate lunch. With no store and restaurant along the way, I had to restrict my water consumption. </p>
  <p>The plan was to drink one bottle of water every 30 km, and I had three water bottles. </p>
  <p>However, due to today’s burning sun, water was consumed faster than I planned.  </p>
  <p>There was no way to get water in this area. Once the water was finished, I could only bike with my thirst. </p>
  <p>Based on today’s experience, aside from the three water bottles, I would need to fill up the 3 liter water bag for safety in the future.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I wore a baseball cap; however, the gust of wind could easily blow it far away. </p>
  <p>I had to prop Dido properly first since Dido did not have a stand, then run for the cap.</p>
  <p> I could not afford to lose a cap again.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030106.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The highway was closed in one direction. The right lane was closed yesterday, </p>
  <p>but the left lane was closed today. I rode on the closed lane.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030122.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>From time to time, I saw road workers resting on the road side; </p>
  <p>I would wave to them and ask for water. They never had spare water for me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030093.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The heat made me feel that I was going to have sunstroke soon, </p>
  <p>I found no place to hide and rest. What should I do?</p>
  <p>Even I stopped for rest, I was still under the blazing hot sun.</p>
  <p>Eventually, I spotted an overpass (who would use it?). </p>
  <p>Even it could only provide me a small shade, oh! it was a gift from god.</p>
  <p>Having propped Dido up, I lay down on the slope. The stones were a bit irritating, </p>
  <p>but lying on the stone felt much comfortable than lying on a spring bed.</p>
  <p>Lying on the slope, with the strong wind, it was very cool ~ I took a short nap </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030102.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The wind has its own direction, if traveling with the wind, you have tailwind, </p>
  <p>if traveling against the wind, you have head wind, if standing still, the wind becomes your breeze.</p>
  <p>Now, I won’t complain under my breath just because the head wind slowed me down.</p>
  <p> It just happened that the wind blew in a direction opposite to my direction.</p>
  <p>A high wind could easily get me to 15 km per hour without any effort on this flat road if it was my tailwind.</p>
  <p>However, with the head wind, no matter how hard I tried, the flat road became a super steep slope, </p>
  <p>I could only reach 8~10 km per hour when I rode against it.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the high wind could become a sudden gust of wind. Dido swayed terribly; </p>
  <p>I had to jump off and bend over on the handle to stabilize the bike.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030129.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The most dangerous photo since I set off was the one I shot with my national flag while no car passed by.</p>
  <p>I liked the desert, even if it was different than what I expected. The extensive view made me feel open-minded.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030089.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Continuing under the blazing hot sun, finally I saw a mirage: a lake in the desert!</p>
  <p>I went crazy finally, was it the power of the desert? </p>
  <p>I still saw the lake after rubbing my eyes, even my camera captured the lake, </p>
  <p>was the camera fainting from the sun’s heat as well?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030124.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As I rode against the head wind, I approached the mirage slowly. It was for real! </p>
  <p>it was such a big body of blue water. I parked Dido, crawled over the barbed wire fence. </p>
  <p>I shouted with excitement and ran to the lake.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I spotted a bunch of white stuff from far away, but I was not sure what it was. </p>
  <p>When I came closer, I realized the white things were sheep.</p>
  <p>The huge herd of sheep was beyond my imagination, many hundreds of them. They grazed along the lake side.</p>
  <p>The sheep were not scared, they just bleated at me. They were so cute, I wanted to take one home.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030137.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This was the owner of the sheep. I asked him how many sheep he had; </p>
  <p>the answer was one thousand and two hundred, an amazing number. </p>
  <p>How could you raise such huge herd of sheep?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030158.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030140.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The lake was crispy clear, the water was icy cool. I could not believe how a lake can survive in a desert.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030157.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was very thirsty and really felt like drinking the water. </p>
  <p>However, the water had floating sheep shit on it. It would definitely give you diarrhea for at least 3 days.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030150.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was so joyful to see so many sheep and such beautiful lake; I chatted with the shepherd and also asked for directions.</p>
  <p>Anxi was about 50 km from here. It would take me more than 4 hours to get there. </p>
  <p>A trip with the head wind would be very exhausting, and in addition, it was already 4:30pm.</p>
  <p>If I did not bike to Anxi, I could find a place just for food and sleep in Shuangta about 3 km ahead.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was a great news that I only needed to ride 3 more Km before resting, </p>
  <p>I ran back to Dido from the lake side followed by a few stupid sheep.</p>
  <p>I hop on Dido. I would rest when I reached the town and finish the rest tomorrow.</p>
  <p>“Extreme pleasure is followed by sorrow”. The barbed wire cut through my rear tire, I got a flat.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I did not feel like changing the tube under the blazing hot sun, so I walked Dido to Shuangta.</p>
  <p>Before getting to Shuangta, I saw a sign “Shuangta Dam”. This lake was a dam!</p>
  <p>There were a few houses along the dam. When I came closer, I saw they were a store, a live fish restaurant and a workers’ camp.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030163.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I almost had happy tears fall when I saw the store, I had been thirsty for so long, my saliva had become pasty. </p>
  <p>I walked over with Dido, opened the fridge, fetched an ice cold cola and took gulps.</p>
  <p>I drank an orange soda right after gulping down the cola, the workers stared at me and could not believe their eyes. </p>
  <p>I started to chat with them after I felt reborn; they were the road workers for Lianhuo highway.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The road worker said this highway was about 5 thousand km long which was China’s longest roadway. </p>
  <p>I was riding on the middle section around 3 thousand km.</p>
  <p>The construction had started almost three years ago; it would replace the old roadway, Route 312, the one I was supposed to ride on.</p>
  <p>The highway would be finished after the guardrails were installed, two more months to go.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The camp was for the road workers. The store only and the live fish restaurant only did business with the road workers.</p>
  <p>After I finished the soda, the people from the restaurant asked me if I would like to eat.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>“yes, of course, I am starving”</p>
  <p>I ordered a braised carp from Shuangta Dam. The fish was still fresh, 16 RMB for one Kg.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before my dinner was ready, I started to change the rear tube in front of the restaurant. </p>
  <p>People started to make a circle around me, and watched me to repair Dido. they also made comments occasionally.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030161.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>“if he does not know his stuff, how can he dare bike solo so far”</p>
  <p>“the tool box wrench is interesting, it includes so many tools”</p>
  <p>“the gear can change, is the bike expensive?”</p>
  <p>“such a tiny pump can do the work, wow! and it even has a tire gauge”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I got a flat tire again right after it was repaired. </p>
  <p>I had pulled out the barbed wire already and did not double-check if something else were inside when I started to fix it.</p>
  <p>Heartbroken! It happened again! I started it over. The road workers gave me a hand to examine it carefully this time. </p>
  <p>We found three thin pieces of barbed wires inside, the tube was badly wounded.</p>
  <p>The second repair was smooth, my flat tires increased to four. I got cut by glass once, and by barbed wire three times.</p>
  <p>I might get 20 punctured tubes before I arrived in Paris.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The fish was ready when I called it a day. </p>
  <p>The road workers said the water from the dam was not drinkable because of the high content of alkaline. </p>
  <p>However, somebody said the water was drinkable, it was snow melting from Qilian Mountain. </p>
  <p>Shuangta Dam could be dated back to the Tang Dynasty, one thousand year ago.</p>
  <p>Well, the water might not be drinkable, but the fish was still edible. </p>
  <p>The braised fish looked nice, the carp was a bit boney, but it was very tasty.</p>
  <p>The fresh fish made the dish taste better. I ate it with twisted steamed rolls. </p>
  <p>Normal food becomes a delicacy after hard work.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>“Will you bike to Anxi today?” everybody asked.</p>
  <p>“No, I am pretty beat. I will stay here tonight and continue tomorrow” I said</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Shuangta had no hotel just a store and a restaurant. </p>
  <p>The camp had been packed with the road workers, so there was no place for me to stay.</p>
  <p>Ha! Don’t worry! I had got a tent and a sleeping bag, and would camp by the dam today, the first camp night since I left Beijing.</p>
  <p>I would like to take advantage of today’s situation. </p>
  <p>I was mentally prepared for camping. It would help me to manage unexpected situations if I was forced to camp.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After dinner, I walked Dido to the lake front, and started to set up the campsite at 8:30 pm in the dusk.</p>
  <p>I had practiced tent setup at my sister’s home. </p>
  <p>This tent was foolproof, all I needed to do was to spread it and insert two tent poles.</p>
  <p>Then, got the inflatable mat into the tent, and pumped air into the mat.  </p>
  <p>The mat gave me the insulation to stop the cold ground from giving me the chills</p>
  <p> (and most importantly, it provided a smooth surface for sleeping, by banishing all those lumps and bumps of uneven ground.)</p>
  <p>Then, I got the sleeping bag into the tent. DONE!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030183.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HASj99cyKko" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>This was a roomy little tent. I could lie on my stomach or on my back. </p>
  <p>Even so, it was too small to keep all the bags inside the tent. Only put my important belongings in the tent.</p>
  <p>Therefore, Dido had to be locked, the bags were tied together with multi-purpose rope, </p>
  <p>and then tied to the tent pole, I would sense it if the bags were touched.</p>
  <p>The lakeside view was attractive. I washed my face and soaked my feet in the lake before sleep. </p>
  <p>It really was cold snow water</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030181.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The sky was completely dark around 9:00PM. When mosquitoes started to buzz,  </p>
  <p>I hid myself in the tent with the mosquito net zipped up. </p>
  <p>This way, I could still enjoy the outside view and the night sky.</p>
  <p>I bought this tent in brother Hu’s store, the tent was easy to setup, easy to use, and really a good buy!</p>
  <p>During the tranquil night, I wrote about today’s trip in the tent without mosquito bothering me, and then slept under star-filled sky. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030192.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This was my first solo camping, I was always fond of being in a small space, such as a penthouse (not the magazine..) or a tent like this,</p>
  <p> it made me feel that I became the entire world, and very happy.</p>
