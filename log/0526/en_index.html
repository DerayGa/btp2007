  <p class="style5">Night Bike Ride to Dunhuang</p>
  <p>It had cooled down by the time I was going to bed. </p>
  <p>I kept my sleeping bag unzipped and used it as a comforter to stay cooler.</p>
  <p>With no light pollution, the sky was amazingly full of stars. It seemed the sky could not hold them all.</p>
  <p>The moon was half and shone like a flash light. Even late at night, I could still see my surroundings.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br />
  The temperature dropped suddenly at around 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning. </p>
  <p>It was probably below 10 degree Celsius. I “mummy” up the sleeping bag after being awakened by the cold.</p>
  <p>10 degree Celsius was nothing as my sleeping bag from Albula was designed to hold warmth down to minus 40 degree Celsius. </p>
  <p>I went back to sleep without worry and enjoyed this rare camping opportunity.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I got up before 6 o’clock in the early morning. It was freezing cold and I shivered since I was just in my shorts and T-shirt. </p>
  <p>I put on my jacket, grabbed my towel, went to the lake, and washed up. </p>
  <p>My hands froze in the lake water,turning shades of red and purple.</p>
  <p>The cold water definitely got rid of my drowsiness completely.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030198.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The east sky had the color of orange. The sun rose at around 6:15am from the horizon to warm up the world.</p>
  <p>Packing up my camping equipment without haste - my tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping mat were indispensable.</p>
  <p>The tent protected me from wind, annoying insect pests, the sleeping bag kept me warm </p>
  <p>and the sleeping mat gave me a sound sleep on a smooth surface. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030212.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Kudos to the camping equipment, I could have been tortured by both the cold </p>
  <p>and the bugs if I slept in the open air without them.</p>
  <p>Next time, if I was in a good mood, I would shop at the market and cook for myself. </p>
  <p>My cookware was the only gear that had not been used yet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I found a few loose spokes when unlocking Dido by surprise. </p>
  <p>They had lost their tension like rubber bands and could not protect the wheels any more.</p>
  <p>Uniform spoke tension was the key to a strong and long lasting wheel. However, </p>
  <p>checking spoke tension was left out of my daily routine. I only checked tire pressure and bolts.</p>
  <p>Tightening up the spokes right away, I was not sure how long the spokes had been loose. One spoke had popped out already.</p>
  <p>The spokes were found loose purely by accident. </p>
  <p>If it was not for the camping and Dido needing to be locked, I would not have touched the spoke. </p>
  <p>If I rode with loose spokes, the wheel could be totally damaged. I felt blessed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After reloading Dido, I walked it back to the highway from the small gravel hill, </p>
  <p>stretched a bit and continued the uncompleted journey towards Anxi.</p>
  <p>The early morning ride was great. The head wind was gone and it was a nice day with no wind. </p>
  <p>Later, I saw the flags along the roadside (the flags with various colors at the construction site served as the road work signs) flying in the wind. </p>
  <p>Then I realized that the wind was with me.</p>
  <p>I had a tailwind instead. It pushed me forward quietly and I was just not aware of it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030218.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When against the wind, we were very sensitive to the wind speed, even if it was a gentle breeze. </p>
  <p>On the contrary, we might ignore a tailwind, even if it was strong. </p>
  <p>We took many things for granted until we lose them and regret it.</p>
  <p>How to manage our lives could be inspired by the wind. </p>
  <p>Never mind about the bad things people had done to you, but be thankful for the good things.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Kudos to the tailwind, no matter that it was flat road, downhill or uphill,my speed was always above 35 km/h. </p>
  <p>Compared with yesterday’s turtle speed (between 8 and 10 km/h), I was flying!</p>
  <p>It was about 50 km from Shuangta to Anxi, usually a 4 hour bike ride. Today, it only took me two hours to get to Anxi.</p>
  <p>I got off the highway at Guazhou county where was not far from Anxi.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030220.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>At 9:30 in the morning, I arrived at my destination and was ready to call it a day. </p>
  <p>I felt unexpectedly relaxed. No doubt about it, I had arrived!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030224.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I found a restaurant and was ready to enjoy a big meal. </p>
  <p>Lunch: A large wonton soup followed by large shaozi noodles!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030226.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I ate like a horse!</p>
  <p>“How can he eat so much?” asked a little girl next door.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030227.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> Kiddo, my stomach has no limit most of time, especially in front of good food.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since I arrived early, I killed time in an Internet café. </p>
  <p>The store owner was nice and let me connect my own computer to the network.</p>
  <p>While I was happily updating the Google Earth track, the owner watched me with great interest. </p>
  <p>However, with him beside me, I could not work on my own stuff….</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I installed Google Earth in his computer so he left me alone and started playing with the new software. </p>
  <p>Then, I began to update my website and wrote emails.</p>
  <p>The store owner did not charge me for the online fee after I installed Google Earth for him. </p>
  <p>I only paid 2 RMB for the first hour when I entered the cafe.</p>
  <p>I spent five good hours in the Internet café, from 10:00 am to 3:00pm when the sun was fierce during the day.</p>
  <p>When everything was done, it was time to look for a hotel. </p>
  <p>I said good bye to the store owner, and thanked for his generosity, </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Tomorrow’s destination of Dunhuang was 120 km away from Anxi. </p>
  <p>Moreover, there would be a 100 km uninhabited area along Mt. Huoyanshan (The Flaming Mountains).</p>
  <p>In order to offset tomorrow’s long ride, I headed further south for another 10 km or so from Anxi. </p>
  <p>I would like to find accommodation for tonight before entering Mt. Huoyanshan.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030228.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The last village before entering the deserted area was Wangjiazhuang, </p>
  <p>where I saw restaurants and stores, but found no hotels.</p>
  <p>The ice pop stand that I had not seen for a while appeared again. </p>
  <p>I bought four green bean ice pops at first. While I was eating the ice pop to cool off, I asked the stand owner for information.</p>
  <p>“Does Wangjiazhuang have hotels?” I asked. </p>
  <p>The stand owner shook his head and said “No, you have go back to Anxi.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sigh! My plan did not seem to work. </p>
  <p>I just got here and had to go back to Anxi for accommodation. My face fell!</p>
  <p>“Will there be any place to stay after entering Mt. Huoyanshan?” I asked</p>
  <p>The stand owner shook his head again and said</p>
  <p> “No, not only is there no place to stay, but also there is no place to eat.”</p>
  <p>It would be a non-stop ride for 110 km and all the way to Dunhuang if I entered Mt. </p>
  <p>Huoyanshan, since there was no place to eat and stay in the desert.</p>
  <p>“It is 4:30 in the afternoon and Dunhuang is 100 km away. I won’t make it today”. </p>
  <p>I thought it over while licking the ice pop. It seemed to have two choices.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>1. Return to Anxi and have a sound sleep tonight. </p>
  <p>Load up on plenty of food and water tomorrow and finish the 120 km ride in one day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>2. Head for Mt. Huoyanshan now, </p>
  <p>camp in the desert without supply stations along the way tonight.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Any person who knew me a bit would know I would prefer to do neither. </p>
  <p>Why go back? Yet only a lunatic would continue.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After four ice pops, I stocked up on another four but did not stop by any store for supplies.  </p>
  <p>Forget about food and drink, the ice pop would be good enough.</p>
  <p>At 5:00pm, I rode through the toll booth. Dunhuang was 95 km away.</p>
  <p> I could either camp, or ride at night and arrive in Dunhuang around 11:00pm.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030247.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Route 313 that led me to Dunhuang was in very good condition. </p>
  <p>Dunhuang would be at the end of the long stretch of road.</p>
  <p>Wow! The road in Mt. Huoyanshan was flat so I did not need to climb up and down. </p>
  <p>In the fierce sun, I listened to the iPod, riding against the wind toward Dunhuang.</p>
  <p>Guess what? After eight ice pops, my stomach was not happy. I had to “handle” it in desert.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030232.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were more clouds in the sky than yesterday, and they were able to block the sun and cool off the heat quite a bit. </p>
  <p>The roadside milestones showed that I was slowly moving at the speed of 1 km every four minutes.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030252.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I rode slowly till 9:00pm when the sun had disappeared below the horizon. </p>
  <p>What had left was the orange sky as this morning.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030259.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was up before sunrise this morning, and I was still on the road after sunset. </p>
  <p>I waved to the sun, see you tomorrow. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By the time I changed my sunglasses and took off my cap, the GPS indicator had started blinking -&gt; low-battery warning. </p>
  <p>No wonder! It had been on for more than 15 hours!</p>
  <p>I turned on the rear flashing bike light and the Luxeon bike headlight, </p>
  <p>finished half bottle of water, inhaled, took a deep breath, and got ready for the night ride.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030265.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>“I won’t make it to DunHuang tonight?”“I won’t make it to Dunhuang today?” </p>
  <p>When I spat it out this afternoon, it had been bothering me ever since. Why would I limit myself?</p>
  <p>Even though the sun had gone down, today was not over yet. </p>
  <p>If I could get in Dunhuang before midnight, I still made it to Dunhuang TODAY.</p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6IYJNtumR3k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My Luxeon bike headlight is a dynamo powered headlight.</p>
  <p> As long as I peddle, I have light. However, the drag from the dynamo makes peddling harder.</p>
  <p>I was happy with the brightness of the light. With the headlight and the rear light on Dido looked like a motorcycle.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I slowly moved towards Dunhuang. Calm night in the desert, I could vividly hear the contact noise of the bike.</p>
  <p>Even thought it was a desert, there were bugs making noise. </p>
  <p>How could they survive in such an environment?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before getting into Dunhuang, I passed by Dunhuang airport. </p>
  <p>The blinking lights of airplanes in the air at night were lovely.</p>
  <p>After passing the airport, people started showing up. I had a sports drink to refresh me at a store which stayed open at 10:30pm.</p>
  <p>My legs felt sluggish. Even so I could still walk and ride. Dunhuang was 8km away, the last half an hour ride for today.</p>
  <p>No street lights at night, the passing taxis from the airport lit the road up occasionally, but it was dark again afterward.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The city lights off in the distance became brighter at night. It must be Dunhuang, 5 km away.</p>
  <p>My tiredness made me feel that the lights were moving away from me when I rode towards them.</p>
  <p>At last, I arrived. The flashing neon lights told me that Dunhuang was a city never slept.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030274.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The first thing after riding into the city was to find me a hotel. </p>
  <p>No shower for 3 days, so I wanted a hotel with a hot shower.</p>
  <p>It was not hard to find such a hotel, enough money can buy it. </p>
  <p>It depended on how much I would like to pay for a hot shower.</p>
  <p>“XinHua Guest House - 24 hour hot water”. </p>
  <p>I propped Dido, then asked the price.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030280.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Standard room: two beds, TV, private toilet and sink, shared hot shower, 50 RMB per night</p>
  <p>The room rate was reduced to 30 RMB per night for three nights after a successful haggle.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I lifted Dido up to the fourth floor, unloaded the bags, washed up, and went down to the front desk asking for a place to eat.</p>
  <p>This city did not let me down. The bustling “Dunhuang Night Market” was just kitty-cornered from the hotel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030276.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The market was full of music, the smell of food, and loud talking.</p>
  <p>Tables were in the center of the open air night market surrounded by food stalls.</p>
  <p>Soon after taking a seat, a waitress in white shirt and black pants showed up. </p>
  <p>She first brought me a plate of melon seeds, asked anything to drink, then gave me the menu.</p>
  <p>No matter what you wanted, she would place the orders with different food stalls and wait on my table. It felt great to be served.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I ordered a large wonton soup, spicy shredded pig ears, one kg of Gobi BBQ and two bottles of ice cold Huang He beers. </p>
  <p>The Huang He beers were made in Lanzhou.</p>
  <p>Lanzhou was 1,000 km away. It was great to taste the beer in Dunhuang, the memorable flavor.</p>
  <p>While listening to the music and enjoying the food and drink, </p>
  <p>I wanted to tell the Deray who was licking an ice pop in the afternoon that</p>
  <p>“I can definitely make it to Dunhuang TODAY!” </p>
