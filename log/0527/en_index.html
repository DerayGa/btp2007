  <p class="style5">Spectacular Mogao Caves</p>
  <p>Stumbling back to the guest house like a drunken dad out of a party, </p>
  <p>I felt very tired and sleepy but still remembered to take a shower before dropping onto the bed.</p>
  <p>Chores like writing up my travel log and washing clothes were left behind. I could not keep my eyes open…</p>
  <p>Waking up naturally before 9:00am, it was not too late. It felt great to get enough sleep.</p>
  <p>Breakfast was a cup of hot brown sugar water. </p>
  <p>I started washing dirty clothes and line-dried them on the multi-purpose rope stretching from the headboard to the window sill.</p>
  <p>With the hot sun and very dry weather, clothes did not take long to dry. I did not even bother squeezing the water out.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030284.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then I started working on the travel log for yesterday’s night ride which was quite exhausting. Why did I push on without a cause?</p>
  <p>I went for a walk after the remaining chores had been finished.</p>
  <p>“Dunhuang Night Market” where I drank last night became “Oasis Market” by day.  Anything could be bought there, you name it.</p>
  <p>The picture shows a stall owner making chili powder.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030294.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>All the stalls selling dry fruit at the pedestrian-only area were alike with not only the same products for sale but also the same stall setup.</p>
  <p>Dried fruit is my favorite – Oh! well, I am from Yilan!</p>
  <p>[Note: Yilan, Taiwan is famous for its dried fruit]</p>
  <p>You could sample anything shown in the picture. One was not enough? </p>
  <p>get a second one, and don’t forget to make comments:</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030302.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>“Not sweet, tasteless” </p>
  <p>“Not pitted – not for me”</p>
  <p>“Need peeling – troublesome”</p>
  <p>Without the comments, the stall owner would automatically bag the one that you just sampled for you.</p>
  <p>There were several goodies. I bought ice plums, almond inside apricots and pearl tomatoes. </p>
  <p>Everything cost either 10 or 12 RMB a Chinese pound – not expensive.</p>
  <p>I grabbed two tasty, but a bit expensive, goodies after paying up, but forgot my bags of dry fruits at the stall.</p>
  <p>Later on, I sensed that I paid for something but my hand was empty – very forgetful.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lunch was at the “Oasis Market”. There were lots of restaurants offering a variety of different cuisines.</p>
  <p>I liked to try the local specialty, so I went to a packed small restaurant and ordered a Dunhuang latiaozi.</p>
  <p>[Note: latiaozi is a noodle; the dough was cut in pieces and then pulled long before being cooked]</p>
  <p>Noodles and sauce are served separately, mix it up yourself.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030305.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The noodles were hand-made, nice and chewy, </p>
  <p>and the sauce was made of a variety of vegetables such as egg plants, winter melons, bell peppers, tomatoes and chili peppers.</p>
  <p>The mixed noodle was yummy and the mild spicy sauce stimulated the appetite.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, I was headed for the most notable attraction in Dunhuang, </p>
  <p>Mogao Caves which was included in the UNESCO world heritage list in 1987.</p>
  <p>[Note: Mogao Caves is also known as Mogao Grottoes or Mogao Ku]</p>
  <p>I asked the guest house staff how to get there by public bus, since it was 25 km from the downtown Dunhuang. </p>
  <p>Taking a taxi would definitely be a rip off!</p>
  <p>My guest house was in a great location, a night market was right in front of it, </p>
  <p>the Dunhuang museum and the Dunhuang theatre were right next to it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030289.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And it was only 3 minutes walk to the public bus stop</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030309.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The buses run every 20 minutes - bus fare: 8 RMB - ride time: 30 minutes.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030409.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was back on the road where I night biked alone last night in the bus. I was glad that it was all over.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ready for the ticket price for Mogao Cave?</p>
  <p>Prequel – the admission fee for other attractions.</p>
  <p>Yellow River: 30 RMB</p>
  <p>Jiayu Pass: 60 RMB</p>
  <p>Emperor Qin’s Terra-Cotta Warriors and Horses Museum: 90 RMB</p>
  <p>Take a guess – how much is the ticket price for Mogao Caves?</p>
  <p><br />
  Ready?</p>
  <p>I asked an ice pop hawker for the ticket price before coming and was totally shocked.</p>
  <p>When handing over the money, 160 RMB, my heart was not bleeding too terribly – it was at least well-prepared.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030325.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Summer is the high season, so the ticket price is raised to 160 RMB for Chinese and 180 RMB for foreign visitors.</p>
  <p>Winter is the low season, half price - 80 RMB.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030335.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Beverages were even more expensive, the 2.5 RMB cola was sold for 6 RMB, </p>
  <p>the 1 RMB water was sold for 5 RMB, and the 0.5 RMB ice pops were sold for 2 RMB.</p>
  <p>Every time I learned a new price, 100 CC of blood were lost. Finally, I did not buy anything.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Stupas were scattered at the entrance, I do not know when they were built. </p>
  <p>They did not seem to be precious; otherwise they won’t be just placed here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030326.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had my camera and notebook ready to visit and record the great statues and murals, </p>
  <p>but photography, recording, cigarettes and backpacks were strictly forbidden. </p>
  <p>Checking in my bag and camera at the gate, I got in and lined up. Staff would divide visitors into small groups.</p>
  <p>Each group with about ten people was assigned a tour guide from Dunhuang Research Institute. Each tour was about 2 hours long.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030333.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are more than four hundred caves and every one is locked. </p>
  <p>They are unlocked only if the visitors are accompanied by tour guides.</p>
  <p>No lighting inside the cave, the guide carries a yellow flashlight and the visitors follow the light pointing at the wall with the explanation.</p>
  <p>When a cave tour is finished, the guide will lock the door if no group is waiting outside.</p>
  <p>They did a very good job of preserving the caves with respect to the visitors.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030340.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are more than four hundred caves, of which you will see only ten caves open to public on the short tour.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030346.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Mogao Cave is a shrine of Buddhist art treasures, the caves construction and maintenance spanned several dynasties.</p>
  <p>Each new dynasty would cover the walls with clay and paint new murals.</p>
  <p>The floor tiles were also layered by one dynasty after another over thousand of years. </p>
  <p>The caves had become a collection of art interactions of the ancient dynasties.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030347.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It’s a pity that I could not take any pictures. However, I did learn many interesting things from the guide.</p>
  <p>The American art thief, Langdon Warner, who used chemicals and tapes to remove twenty six murals, was always mentioned by the guides.</p>
  <p>However, only eleven wall paintings were restored. The rest of them disappeared from art history forever.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The library cave used to store fifty thousand precious manuscripts sealed off thousand years ago </p>
  <p>was eventually rediscovered during the international &quot;Joint Army of the Eight Powers&quot;. </p>
  <p>During war time, nobody cared about what had been found in a little town in the far northwest reaches of China.</p>
  <p>The discovery brought archaeologists from Japan, France, Russia and elsewhere flooding into Dunhuang and they promptly emptied the cave. </p>
  <p>They stole or purchased by deceit more than eighty percent of precious manuscripts which ended up in foreign counties. </p>
  <p>What had left were only incomplete fragments. However, the discovery of the library cave cultivated the study of Dunhuang culture.</p>
  <p>Chinese scholars said that the library cave is Dunhuang’s forever heart-broken archaeological site…</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The art of the Mogao Caves is composed of cave architecture, murals and sculptures:</p>
  <p>1. Cave architecture</p>
  <p>There are many variations in the architecture of the 492 caves, some have a rectangular roof and some are in human shape. </p>
  <p>The caves also vary in size, from tiny to huge.</p>
  <p>The temperature inside the caves is as cool as if air-conditioned, in spite of the scorching heat outside.</p>
  <p>The grottos were all carved out of the rock in three tiers, and the large ones are as high as 40 meters extending inwards tens of meters.</p>
  <p>The cave number system was first done by French who looted the most precious literary works.</p>
  <p>Then, the Chinese painter Zhang Daqin numbered the caves. He liked the murals very much.</p>
  <p>Finally, the Dunhuang Research Institute took over the cave numbering.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>2. Murals</p>
  <p>In spite of the erosion caused by wind or carbon dioxide for more than 1,300 years, </p>
  <p>the 45,000 square meters of murals still keep their bright colors</p>
  <p>Why have the wall paintings retained much of their bright hues? </p>
  <p>The answer is that the minerals used as pigments are stable and withstood the test of time.</p>
  <p>In addition to thousands of Buddha images painted on the walls, the murals are like today’s comic books, depicting a variety of Buddhist stories.</p>
  <p>Siddartha’s previous lives, the travel of Zhang Qian to the West, a little prince sacrificing himself to save tigers. Everything was vividly painted.</p>
  <p>The murals touch on a wide range of activities, including social activities, architectures, music, clothing, and transportation. </p>
  <p>The Dunhuang scholars have likened the murals to a priceless museum on walls.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>3. Sculptures</p>
  <p>In the caves there are some 2,400 painted sculptures, some are tiny in size and some are 30 meters in height.</p>
  <p>In the heyday of the Tang dynasty, the cave sculptures were of the finest quality from the finger poses, </p>
  <p>facial expressions,  and the folds in the clothes.</p>
  <p>The guide also complimented the sculptures done in the Song dynasty. </p>
  <p>It is a pity that most of the Song sculptures were on the first floor, they had been completely damaged and very few survived.</p>
  <p>The funniest thing was the guide did not spend much time on the sculptures done in the Qing dynasty because they were of poor quality.</p>
  <p>They did not give the Qing dynasty any credit at all.</p>
  <p>I am fond of Xixia’s lotus floor tiles, very pretty. The title patterns and the sandwich cookie patterns are alike. </p>
  <p>Then I noticed that I had no idea about Xixia and wondered what kind of dynasty it was?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Each of the ten grottos that I visited had its own characteristics and artistic style, </p>
  <p>and the guide was nice and professional, so the 160 RMB admission fee was well-spent.</p>
  <p>I felt pleased that I had came here during my lifetime. It was my honor to visit Mogao Caves.</p>
  <p>The 2-hour tour was very short – I was deeply moved by the variety of caves with their individual art.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030366.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>No camera was allowed within the fenced-off area, there were many photographers outside offered photo service.</p>
  <p>For people who like to take pictures of tourist spots, this is a nice service. It is about 10 RMB a picture.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030362.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I wandered in the shopping area after the tour.</p>
  <p>The souvenir stands could be classified into “for the wealthy” and “for the poor”.</p>
  <p>The mural duplicates of high quality are sold at the “for the wealthy” store, and labeled with price tags in RMB, USD and JPY. </p>
  <p>The average price is about 5,000 RMB. Now, you have some idea about the consumer capabilities of the wealthy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030397.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The “for the poor” stands selling silk scarves and small jewelry were the place for me. </p>
  <p>I felt like buying a scarf to cover my face.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030372.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am headed to Xinjiang which is at higher altitude than Gansu, and needed to prepare myself for the high temperate in the desert.</p>
  <p>I tried on a black scarf.</p>
  <p>“You look like a Muslim” said the stall owner with smile on his face </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030379.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The black one was hot and thick, I almost could not breath. </p>
  <p>I bought a blue one made with breathing material – 20 RMB.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030380.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then, I saw a man making painting on white shirts and asked his permission before taking pictures of him.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030384.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>However, I could not afford the hand-painted shirt, so I just bought small items like this square fabric with “Silk Road” on it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030390.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030388.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Postcards were one item I would buy since they were done by professionals and had better quality than my own shots. </p>
  <p>They also gave out flavor of traveling.</p>
  <p>I chose a Dunhuang 14 scenes combination package containing 22 cards – 40 RMB on price tag. </p>
  <p>The stall staff gave me a discount – half price, 20 RMB.</p>
  <p>Wasn’t it over-exaggerated? The price was cut in half before I even started bargaining, </p>
  <p>which told me that I would be an idiot not to haggle.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030391.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I got a 20 RMB bill out and told the stall staff “this is all I got,</p>
  <p>and I need to take the public bus back to Dunhuang downtown before handing over the money,</p>
  <p>It was obvious that they either sold it for 12 RMB or did not sell it at all.</p>
  <p>Of course, he took the money and gave me the 8 RMB change with no hesitation. </p>
  <p>His quick reaction made me wonder what the real cost of the postcards were with a feeling of regret.</p>
  <p>Never mind, at least it was discounted and I did have more than 20 RMB in my pocket.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030393.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The Dunhuang train station is on the way to Dunhuang downtown, </p>
  <p>in the suburbs close to the airport. It seemed it was under reconstruction. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030414.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I bought an ice cold juice to quench my thirst after getting back to downtown. </p>
  <p>Only if money were not money, would I pay the boosted prices at the tourist attraction.</p>
  <p>I got a 20 RMB cents bill change back that I had never seen before. It had Korean influence.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030419.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Tonight, I had lamb meat fen soup, stir-fried lamb offal and xinpi water for dinner at the “Oasis Market” again.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030420.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The lamb meat fen soup was lamb meat with vermicelli in light broth – quite yummy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030423.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As for the stir-fried lamb offal, I could not figure it out what they were either by looking or by tasting. </p>
  <p>However the cumin in the dish made everything tasty.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030424.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The large ice cold “xinpi water” tasted like the lighter version of the dark plum juice. </p>
  <p>It has the nickname ‘remedy for summer heat” which was very true.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today’s expense including the entrance fee for Mogao Caves, small souvenirs, food and drink was about 300 RMB.</p>
  <p>Tomorrow I would be visiting Crescent Lake and Mt Mingsha</p>
  <p> [also known as Mingsha Mountain, Singing Sand Mountain or Echoing Sand Mountain]. </p>
  <p>The entrance fee was 80 RMB and the camel ride fee was 60 RMB. </p>
  <p>Dunhuang just burned my travel money!!<br />
    </p>
  <p>Today was the day which made me feel that I was really traveling the Silk Road. </p>
  <p>If it was possible, I would like to stay one more day to explore more of the attractions of the Silk Road.</p>
