  <p class="style5">A Ruined Ruin</p>
  <p>I have for the past two days, went through Mogao Caves, Yueya Springs and the other popular tourist spots that is within the reach of a bus. </p>
  <p>All the other famous attractions are quite a distant away, 70 ~ 100km away. </p>
  <p>You have to rely on taxis and the price is then undetermined. </p>
  <p>So my target today is the Ancient City of Dunhuan, which is about 15km away. What attracts me is it being labeled as an Ancient City.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The employees at the hostel don’t know for sure how to get there though, </p>
  <p>suggest that I walk west ward to the West Bridge, there’s a bus station and may offer me a solution. </p>
  <p>So I grabbed a packet of “little basket buns” for breakfast and stroll toward the West Bridge Station. </p>
  <p>Dunhuan city center is a rather small but really busy, the suburbs though are rather bleak. </p>
  <p>I asked quite a few bus drivers at the station but it seems there are no direct route to the Ancient City. </p>
  <p>There are bus routes passing by, but I will have to stop a passing by bus on the way back. </p>
  <p>Sounds to be a minor problem so off I go on a bus to Nanhu. </p>
  <p>When I got on the bus there are a few passengers already but no driver, so I asked when does this bus leave. </p>
  <p>“15h00”. </p>
  <p>What the heck?!!! It’s 09h30 in the morning now! </p>
  <p>Why the hell would you guys sit on this bus for?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030618.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I sure am not going to sit there and wait. Left the station and strolling at a wholesale market. </p>
  <p>Gonna grab something to nibble and perhaps find a way to get to the Ancient City. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030624.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Bought 500g of raisins to nibble. These are green ones and really nice. Not very commercial, </p>
  <p>just a whole grape dried. I also bought about 500g worth of pan fried cakes (stuffed with mince &amp; vegetables) for reserves. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030620.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Eventually I came across a grocer where I bought two ice popsicles and asked the shopkeeper if he knew any way to get to the Ancient City. </p>
  <p>What bugged me why is there not a direct route to this site? </p>
  <p>Isn’t this site supposed to be a popular tourist spot? </p>
  <p>Luckily the shopkeeper used to be a taxi driver and he has a friend who is still in this business, the fare is 20 RMB. </p>
  <p>Obviously that’s a bit more than the bus fare but still acceptable, so off I go in a taxi.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Paging through the brochure in the taxi it offers Chinese, English and Japanese translations. </p>
  <p>What the Chinese refers as “Ancient City” the Japanese is referring it as a “Ancient City Movie Set”, </p>
  <p>huh? Why such a difference? Well, when I got there and paid my 30 RMB ticket I realize the Japanese translation is more accurate.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030626.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030627.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The Ancient City is actually a movie set left form the days when a Japanese film company made a movie named “Dunhuan”. </p>
  <p>It was supposed to be burnt down but was kept.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030700.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Everything inside is fake, nothing reminds you of a anything ancient or historical.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030680.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If any of these photos could even attract you to spend any time or money here, I can only say the photos are well shot.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030630.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030632.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030641.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is a dungeon that often appears on movies and it is housing a rabbit now. Is there a point to this at all?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030655.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030663.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even the workshop where they built the set is included in the site. There are still incomplete work and saw dusts everywhere,</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030672.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Here’s some weird kind of cells. Scarecrow used as prisoners. </p>
  <p>The markings on the uniforms tells me there are headed for a death sentence. :P</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030673.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030676.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There’s also a market but it is just shallow and pointless. </p>
  <p>They could have hired or allowed a couple of peddlers and dress them up in historical clothing, </p>
  <p>that would have offered more flavor and more fitting. </p>
  <p>Maybe even a few guys walking on the street to make it more of a realistic feeling?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030682.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030687.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Ancient City looked promising on the outside but is rather disappointing inside.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030707.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030709.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I think I spent 15 minute walking around and took a few photos and asked the taxi to take me back. </p>
  <p>I did however, went pass the famous “White Horse Tower” which is said to have 1600 years of history.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030734.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As with most towers built and named “White Horse” in China,</p>
  <p> this tower was built as a memorial for the white horse that carried the Buddhism literatures from India to China.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030717.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Paid two tickets, 30 RMB and 15 RMB and I spent less than half an hour on it. </p>
  <p>I spent more time on the taxi, damn! </p>
  <p>After I got back to the hostel I took a four hour nap. It’s been a while to be this lazy. I feel better already.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Decided to check out the Dunhuan Museum just around the corner. </p>
  <p>Thought I have been disappointed twice this morning, this can’t be any worse even if I blew another 15 RMB away.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030813.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The museum is separated in six halls, three of them showing the Han great wall digs and some of the graves they discovered.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030804.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am extremely amazed by the fact that a portion of the Han dynasty (200 B.C. ~ 220 A.D.) Great Wall still exists today.</p>
  <p> It is a very simple construction but strong enough to stand through centuries.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030741.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The chopstick and the wooden spoon is about a thousand year’s old. </p>
  <p>The brush like tools on the upper left hand corner are “lice brushes”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030745.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The Imperial Decree, it even started with the famous phrase “in the name of the Lord”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030750.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is a wooden engraving of Buddhism literature in Sanskrit. </p>
  <p>I have a traveling book &quot;Cien años de soledad&quot; which I travel with that has a piece of journal written by a Gypsy named Melquíades. </p>
  <p>The journal was only translated about a hundred years after it was written by the Buendía family and the journal was written in Sanskrit.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030756.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Sanskrit looks like tadpoles, how does anyone able to read this, </p>
  <p>no wonder you have to bring monks from India to tanslate.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030766.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>These are what left after the vandalism at the Mogao Caves. </p>
  <p>Most of the literature was stolen and are either stored at museums around the world or in the hands of private collectors.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030770.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>These sculptures are part of a burial, I wonder what the posture symbolizes.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030778.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The other three halls are shops. Misasa, they have your favorite elephants but really expensive, sorry I can’t afford it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030811.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>15 RMB worth of a ticket at least bought me a valuable hour in the museum. </p>
  <p>Strolled to the Dunhuan Night Market and had barbeque lamb chops for dinner. </p>
  <p>The taxi driver this morning is a local and I asked him what’s good to eat.</p>
  <p> I have tried Dunhuan hand rolled noodle, yellow noodles with donkey meat, lamb noodle soup, stir fried lamb organs </p>
  <p>and apricot flavored water, the lamb chop is what I have missed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030822.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>500g of barbeque lamb chops is only 25 RMB, that’s about 26 chops. </p>
  <p>It is tender and tasty, none of those infamous lamb tastes, really, really tasty. </p>
  <p>This is one of best treat when you down it with a cold one.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030826.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am scheduled to leave Dunhuan tomorrow. I have spent three days resting and I feel I am 120% recovered. </p>
  <p>Even more energized before I left Beijing. Long roads ahead and I am ready.</p>
