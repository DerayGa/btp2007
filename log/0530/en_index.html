  <p class="style5">Straight road to the horizon</p>
  <p>I mainly rely on my two feet and bus during the three-day-stay in Dunhuang. </p>
  <p>Therefore Dido and I both got plenty of rest during the stay.</p>
  <p>I packed up my belongings and bought some more snacks as supply. </p>
  <p>Since some of the snacks are dried fruit, I need to store it properly or it might be rotten before I eat it.</p>
  <p>Now I am a little confused about the time zone. The time on my watch is still in Taiwan Time, which is GMT +8. </p>
  <p>However, at the border of Xinjiang and Gansu, I should apply GMT +7 or +6. </p>
  <p>Hum.. feeling lazy to adjust this thing. The GMT +8 stays on my watch. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It feels good to ride on Dido again. It feels just like a beginning of another journey. </p>
  <p>Today I am going to head north. The goal for today is Liuyuan, which is about 130 kilometer outside Dunhuang. </p>
  <p>After one night stay in Liuyuan, I will be in the territory of Xinjiang tomorrow. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030828.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The road that leads me today, the national highway no. 215, </p>
  <p>appears to be a perfect straight line heading northeast by north,on both the paper map and the Google map. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030830.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is cool to get off early, but the temperature is a little bit low in the morning. </p>
  <p>Even though the sun shows his face, the temperature is still only around 20 degree Celsius. </p>
  <p>Even with my gloves, my fingers outside the glove are still as cold as ice. My feet are also freezing inside the sox and shoes. </p>
  <p>However, it is easy to warm them up. Kick in the pedals, and my body start to warm up after a while on the road. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I did not have my breakfast in Dunhuang. I was planning to eat in town, but failed to find a shop there. </p>
  <p>After I am confident that there is only desert ahead, I take out the bum and start biting it. </p>
  <p>I finished all the bum at once, and drank a whole bottle of water. </p>
  <p>Totally stuffed. I am a bit too greedy this time. Those foods are enough for two meals but I finished in one. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is no mystery lies in this perfectly straight road. By the time I am on it,</p>
  <p> it appears to be a normal tar road across the desert, and it happens to be very straight. </p>
  <p>Humming some tunes, I advance in the cool air. </p>
  <p>Thanks to the fact that I departs earlier in the year, I avoids the torture of oven like heat in desert during July and August.</p>
  <p>The national highway no. 215 connects Dunhuang and Liuyuan. Almost no one habitats in between. </p>
  <p>Besides a small village which is 50 kilometer outside Dunhuang, </p>
  <p>which will supply me some food and shelter, the rest of the road is completely desolate. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030861.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since I left early in the day, and the easy road in the first half of the road, I arrived at this village at half past ten AM.</p>
  <p>It is a little bit too early for lunch, but I do not know what to do if I don't have a meal here.</p>
  <p> I ordered a dish of stir-fry noodle in a restaurant.</p>
  <p>Side with a dish of cauliflower since I also want some vege. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before the dish get to my table, I walk around to see what they have in this small town. </p>
  <p>I taste some crunchy grains at this place. Those hard grains like green beans and corns become so crunchy after being baked. </p>
  <p>It feels like I am not having grains but crackers. </p>
  <p>I can chew these stuff without hurting my teeth. However the downside is that it comes with no spice, </p>
  <p>and is a bit tasteless. In the end I bought nothing from here. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030841.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Back to the restaurant. The delicious food is on the table. Stir-fry noodle seems good and delicious. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030845.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But the cauliflower is nothing like what I have in mind. I was planning to get some mild vegetables, </p>
  <p>but this dish of cauliflower comes with all the spicy oils, soy sauces and chili pepper. </p>
  <p>I am really amazed that a simple dish of cauliflower has this kind of potential. </p>
  <p>This is totally salty. With more than ten cup of tea, I finished all the food. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030847.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Rest for half an hour after meal is the golden rule to keep your stomach healthy. </p>
  <p>Since it is still quite early, I sit at the door and trying to be a lucky charm for the restaurant. I dozed till noon under the shade. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although my watch said it is noon, the sun is not directly above me. It was until 2 PM, the sun finally hangs straight above me </p>
  <p>It is a bit boring on this road. The desert stays the same all the time, and so does the road. </p>
  <p>One hour or two hours of riding dose not change the view a bit. </p>
  <p>I walk Dido into the desert. The sand on the surface becomes chips on the ground, but crushes like potato chips when I step on it. </p>
  <p>Beneath this thin layer of chip, sand occupied all the space. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030834.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The endless electric pole lined up aside the road, at a distance of fifty-meter from the edge of road. </p>
  <p>Just like the road, the line of electric pole extends to the horizon. </p>
  <p>I find out that I am now in a small world that has mirrors in front and in back of me, </p>
  <p>and the same view endlessly reflects and expends around me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030854.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The mirage hangs there above the distant desert. It looks like a lake and has some reflection of trees in it. </p>
  <p>However, it is a purely optical illusion. No matter how far you go you see only desert. </p>
  <p>It is only the fate can bring me the surprise I have in the Shuangta Dan. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030859.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I have taken a lot of photo of the plants habitats the desert. </p>
  <p>The water from the hotel is very hard, and you will find some white power stuff at the bottom of the water bottle. </p>
  <p>This kept me from drinking the last sip of the water. Or I might end up with coughing and trying to get those powders out of my mouth. </p>
  <p>So I just splash the last sip of water on these desert-proof plants. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030865.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Finally I see some uphill slope on the later half of the road. I will climb from 1150 meter at Dunhuang to 1750 at Liuyuan. </p>
  <p>This is not a challenge to me. </p>
  <p>The wind also blows stronger in the after noon. Without trying to break the wind too much, </p>
  <p>I slowly moved on the straight road, trying to preserve my energy. </p>
  <p>There are fewer and fewer honks now, and I can hear more and more applauses.</p>
  <p> I feel a little bit embarrassed by the applauses and deliver my appreciations in return with nodding. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030873.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Maybe it is because of the slow speed. I don't feel tired at all when I arrived at Liuyuan at 7 PM.</p>
  <p>Liuyuan is a mining city. I don’t know what they are mining, but there are a lot of miners here. </p>
  <p>Both male and female, they all wear the big white masks and dirty clothes, working very hard at this place. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030876.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I found a cheap hotel that cost 10 bucks. It’s a room for four, but tonight I am the only occupant. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030877.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030879.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I washed my clothes first, and walk around this town with my beloved plastic slipper. </p>
  <p>Luckily I found the market here, which resembles the local spirits most. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030884.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And I get the chance to buy a lot of affordable supplies here. </p>
  <p>After shopping around, I decided to go with the fruits. It's been a while since I last have fruits.</p>
  <p>Since I have not tried the oranges here, I bought one kilogram of orange. </p>
  <p>7-8 oranges costs only 5 bucks, and I get the chance to supply some vitamin C </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030887.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>With a bag of orange in hand, I walked around looking for good restaurant. </p>
  <p>The dinner today is the stewed mutton with brown sauce, which is the recommendation by the shop lady. </p>
  <p>I originally ordered the boiled mutton since I have never taste of it. </p>
  <p>However, the shop lady says that if I am into spicy food, the choice will be the stewed mutton with brown sauce. </p>
  <p>This restaurant is one of it’s kind. They are awarded as the &quot;model business of the year &quot; and &quot;model individual business&quot; every year. </p>
  <p>These flags are all over the wall. </p>
  <p>The other customers saw me and asked me if I am the one who biked form Dunhuang on National highway 215 today. </p>
  <p>Most of they pass me by on the road, and did not expect me to arrive at Liuyuan today. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030891.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Compared to chicken, pork or beef, the texture of Mutton is very soft. </p>
  <p>Just try not to think of the goats and you can enjoy Mutton without a problem. </p>
  <p>The bread did not come with any flavor, but put some sauce on it makes it very delicious. </p>
  <p>With some bread and the news on the television, the dinner time passed happily. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On my way back to hotel, I get some more milk, cracker and egg rolls. </p>
  <p>There is still space in the backpack and I can still carry all of these. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030897.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The oranges makes great after meal. With all the new supplies in the bag, I felt much safer. </p>
  <p>Even if I got lost in the desert for three days, I will still have some food and only need to worry about water. </p>
