  <p class="style5">Xingxing Xia</p>
  <p>Every morning, I started my day by waking up the hotel staff. </p>
  <p>Don’t think I was the only early bird in China. By the time I left the hotel, </p>
  <p>the street cleaners had already done sweeping the street, and were waiting for the garbage to burn out. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030900.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Hard-working miners also started their day —or they took shifts so the work can get done 24 hours non-stop?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030902.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>With no luck finding any restaurant/stall for breakfast, I decided to move on to Rt 312, and head for Xingxing Xia. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030905.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I made my own breakfast-on-the-&quot;bike&quot;: crackers, milk, and raisins.</p>
  <p>Since this was a pretty remote area, I &quot;ordered&quot; the same lunch as well.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030907.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And I told myself, &quot;Look around! You are lucky to even have food&quot;. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The weather in the morning was pretty breezy and comfortable. </p>
  <p>I'd better ride faster for now. Once the wind started to blow crazy in the afternoon, I would have a hard time just to &quot;move&quot;. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>From Gansu to Xinjiang was all alternating uphill and downhill ride, not much of elevation, </p>
  <p>but I did cut through several mountains. </p>
  <p>The deeper I biked into the remote area, the more I was proud of myself carrying more-than-enough of food </p>
  <p>and drinks on my Dido. I can almost open a mobile grocery stand with these foods.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030922.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I noticed that I was on 3333 (I called it four 3s) mile mark on Rt 312, </p>
  <p>I couldn't remember when was the last time I hit &quot;four 2s&quot;, but I know I still have a long way to go on this journey.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030945.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pfU-TRJbz54" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>It was about 5 hours on the bike, and I had passed so many mountains. </p>
  <p>The desert also changed its color, from light brown, to white, and now was red. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030951.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040001.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I felt pretty lack of energy at this moment, I wondered if that's because I didn't take enough break so far. </p>
  <p>How much longer can I finally arrive at Xingjinag?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030935.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>He was the first Urumqi native I met. He had been traveling from Urumqi to Lhasa, and now on the way back home. </p>
  <p>He asked me,&quot; Are you going home, too?&quot; My home is thousands of kilometers away.  </p>
  <p>I am traveling &quot;away&quot; from home.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030928.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just when I was about to doze off, ON THE BIKE, I saw a little &quot;store&quot;, covered by some black sheet. </p>
  <p>I went close to check it up and found it sells watermelon.</p>
  <p>Why did they sell watermelons at a place like this? Their major customers are the truck drivers, I came here was purely by chance.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030960.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>These watermelons were harvested from the owner's farm at Xian, and transported here to sell during the summer time.</p>
  <p>Here is the truck. The front side is the store; behind it is where they sleep at night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030967.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I asked the lady to pick a proper size of watermelon for me; I wanted to finish it before I moved on. </p>
  <p>I can eat about half a jin (1 Jin is roughly 1.1 pound, or 0.5 kg) of dumplings at once, </p>
  <p>but watermelon? Of course I can't stuff myself with 10 jins of it, can I?</p>
  <p>Well, it was still early. I can eat this as my lunch, I would take my time, and I was sure that eventually, I would finish it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Every customer came here for watermelons will ask what were those dark brown-ish stuffs lying there? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030970.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Ha, I asked the same question already, so I was so qualified to answer this.</p>
  <p>&quot;That is called Suoyang (Songaria Cynomorium Herb), also known as desert ginseng. </p>
  <p>It is good for men—if you know what I mean. You usually soak it into wine and drink it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The mother and the daughter were in charge of selling watermelons at this store, </p>
  <p>while rest of the family members stayed at Xian, to take care of Lanzhou honeydew melons and cottons.</p>
  <p>If you ask me what's special about the melons here? I would say, hmm, too many seeds, too many big seeds. </p>
  <p>But even so, it was quite sweet, not bad at all.</p>
  <p>While I was enjoying my watermelon, the lady next door (next store) came to fill up her water and asked me about my trip.  </p>
  <p>To me, what I really wanted to ask was what they ate for the whole summer. Please don't tell me ONLY watermelons…</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On this photo, from right to left: the daughter, the mom, and the lady next store.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030972.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After finishing half o the watermelon, I had to get up to walk it off---evaporate the water out of my body, </p>
  <p>literally, then I came back to finish up the rest of the melon.</p>
  <p>It was so hot out there. I had to hide under the shade that this store provided; </p>
  <p>I ate my watermelon here, and rested a bit afterwards, too.</p>
  <p>I looked into my backpacks, and I decided to share my oranges.</p>
  <p> I gave them one each, but they were concerned that I might get hungry later, so they three shared only one.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I really had a great time chatting with them. The mother wanted to give me a watermelon, but I really can't carry this huge melon with me. </p>
  <p>So, she gave me this pancake that was bigger than my face.</p>
  <p>It was pretty dry to begin with, and this one was even &quot;drier&quot; because it was &quot;sun-dried&quot;. It felt pretty rough on the surface.</p>
  <p>After taking some bites, I knew I had found my brick flatbread a best friend. </p>
  <p>They were definitely made for each other, and they both can break your teeth.I</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030974.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>wanted to pay the mother some cash for this cake, but I knew she won't accept it. </p>
  <p>She wanted to make sure I have enough food on the road.</p>
  <p>I guess that was because what I said earlier that after biking more than 100 km without seeing any civilization, </p>
  <p>I told myself that I will always have enough food in my backpacks. </p>
  <p>Well, I can't pay her money. So I shared the egg rolls as my token of appreciation, and they finally accepted it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We talked and talked, until almost 2:00 in the afternoon. And I was only 20 km away from my destination, so I was in no rush at all.</p>
  <p>However, the wind started to get stronger, even this little store was going to fly up to the sky.  </p>
  <p>It agreed again with what others told me about the strong wind in the afternoon.</p>
  <p>Well, I thought this is the hint for me to move on, so I packed that brick flatbread into my backpacks, </p>
  <p>but left the egg rolls on the table, &quot;gift exchange&quot;.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As I continued my journey, I noticed something interesting. </p>
  <p>It was exactly the same road. In the morning, I had a great time enjoying the biking. </p>
  <p>In the afternoon, the strong upwind totally changed the scenario: it was so difficult to keep moving forward.</p>
  <p>So I tried to see it as a warm-up for later challenges that I will encounter, and I knew there would be MANY.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I can't help but taking some photos here. This &quot;red&quot; desert is really beautiful when you look at it from a distance.  </p>
  <p>Feels like the whole desert is on fire, feels like I am brought back to ancient China.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1030996.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was riding uphill after leaving the watermelon store, and the very top would be the Xingxing Xia. </p>
  <p>I had to work really hard on the paddle.</p>
  <p>All I had in mind was TOMORROW. It is around 200 km between Xingxing Xia and Hami, </p>
  <p>the chances to meet anybody in-between will be very slim, the only stop in-between will be a camel stop, </p>
  <p>the only scene I will see is Gobi desert.</p>
  <p>Therefore, I have only two options: camping, or ride the whole 200 km in one day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I saw a guy wearing a straw hat and sitting by his luggage in the middle of nowhere. My first thought was, he was a homeless.</p>
  <p>But, he was studying the map, a CHINESE map. I guessed he was also a traveler, </p>
  <p>maybe by hitch-hiking?  Well, look at how carefree he was, I grinned.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040002.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was about 2 km away from Xingxing Xia, the new sign has Chinese and another interesting language, </p>
  <p>which looked like two flowers blooming in the desert.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040004.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This was the first time I saw a sign pointing Urumqi, which is a couple of thousands away from Beijing.</p>
  <p>After biking for over a month, finally I was only 700 km away from the capital of Xinjiang, </p>
  <p>Urumqi, which might take me from 7-10 days to arrive. </p>
  <p>The arrival of Urumqi also means the journey in China territory will end soon.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040005.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Finally, I entered Xingxing Xia at around 4:00 in the afternoon. </p>
  <p>The place with such a pretty name—Xingxing means stars in Chinese, turned out was not that pretty after all.</p>
  <p>Since there was no rest area around 100 km before or after, </p>
  <p>this place was full of trucks parking there while the drivers take a break and have lunch.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040020.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Lots of restaurants, truck repair shops, grocery stores, and three gas stations. Not really for tourists.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I decided to stay here for one night, 10 RMB, because of its name, Xingxing Xia.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040006.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was a nice room, decent size, and came with coal and furnace. You can put the coals into the furnace if necessary.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040010.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There was no tap water, though.  So I had to fetch a pail of water and used that to clean up myself. Suddenly I felt so much better.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had my dinner at the restaurant next door, I ordered a lamb soup, stir-fried bok choi with pork, and steamed twisted rolls.</p>
  <p>The TV in the restaurant couldn't play regular programs due to lack of signals, </p>
  <p>so they played karaoke VCD instead. Listening to these weird songs, I finally had my first REAL meal on the table for today. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040013.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The backyard of this hotel was very spacious and not much light to affect the star-watching. </p>
  <p>Since this place is called Xingxing Xia, there was no way I would miss the opportunity to view the stars at night.</p>
  <p>I went to bed very early at night, got up at 3:00 and took some photos of the sky that was filled with stars, totally overwhelming to me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040025.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Luckily, I caught some shooting stars and the big dipper on my photos. </p>
  <p>Shiveringly, I stood under the starry sky, and enjoyed the peaceful and yet noisy atmosphere at this special night.</p>
