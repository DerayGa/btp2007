  <p class="style5">Hami Melon</p>
  <p>It was almost 10:00pm when I got into Hami. After dinner and shower, it was close to midnight.</p>
  <p>The 200 km ride left me exhausted so I was too tired to write up my travel log in bed – well, I just went to bed.</p>
  <p>Tomorrow, I could wake up naturally without worrying about using an alarm clock.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I spotted a washing machine in the hotel last night – free of charge.</p>
  <p>I felt much more relaxed when the washing machine did the laundry for me. </p>
  <p>In addition, its spin drier helped the clothes dry faster.</p>
  <p>Here is the hotel that I stayed at. </p>
  <p>The hotel owner did cell phone business on the first floor, and his hotel was on the second floor. </p>
  <p>The next door was a car wash. I dried my clothes on the washing line in front of car wash store.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040155.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After laundry, I felt relieved and relaxed. The travel log was also finished. So I went for a walk on the street.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had a Saturday deadline to meet every week.</p>
  <p>If I could get online before Sunday, especially on Saturday, I would be greatly pleased.</p>
  <p>I lived through consecutive three days in the desert earlier, and only food and drink concerned me.  </p>
  <p>Now, I was back in the city and started looking for an internet café again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I took a large bag of little basket buns on the go, and looked for an internet café. </p>
  <p>I would ask younger people for internet café information.</p>
  <p>Whiling away the time in the internet café, it was delightful to learn that my English trip log translation was getting into full swing. </p>
  <p>Thanks to my friends, H2 and MD, for their great help.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I left for lunch at 2:00pm. Having eaten too many noodles, I wanted a change and picked the Shandong dumpling restaurant.</p>
  <p>Here again, dumplings were charged by number instead of by weight. </p>
  <p>I ordered twenty big meat dumplings and a cucumber with mashed garlic for my appetizer.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040109.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After lunch I went back to the hotel to get Dido, and wandered around the city on my bike. </p>
  <p>I had asked around (including the hotel owner, internet café staff, and the lady owner of the dumpling restaurant) for Hami attractions. </p>
  <p>They all said there was really nothing worth a visit, which was a sort of sad answer. </p>
  <p>Since I had only known Hami as a name in a book, it would be nice to see it with my own eyes.</p>
  <p>Today’s goal was to eat melons. How could you miss Hami melons in Hami?</p>
  <p>Wasn’t the statue standing in the roundabout holding the famous local produce?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040119.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I ventured out without a map, and had to keep track of street names and direction when making turns. </p>
  <p>Even though Hami was not a big city, it was not small either. </p>
  <p>It would be embarrassing if I got lost and wasn’t able to find my way back to the hotel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040135.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were many marketplaces in Hami. I stopped by every one that I passed and saw if there was anything I would buy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040134.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I would like to try Hami melons, but did not see one at the fruit stall on the street.</p>
  <p>It turned out that the melons in the center with an elongated oval shape and dark yellow rind were Hami melons, </p>
  <p>quite different than the ones sold in Taiwan.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040144.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were some dark patches on the melons’ outer skin. I asked the stall owner if they had gone bad.</p>
  <p>He said they changed color after they were completely ripe, very sweet, but if I did not believe him, he would cut one for me. </p>
  <p>I did not have to pay or buy if it was not good and sweet.</p>
  <p>Because of the store owner’s confidence in his fruit, I bought a Hami melon grown in Hami.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040145.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The stall owner gave me a fruit knife to cut the melon on a cardboard myself.</p>
  <p>The sharp knife cut through the melon easily, oh! man, it smelled good. The sweet aroma was lingering in the air.</p>
  <p>It has very thin skin, only 1 millimeter. After seeding, I could eat up the entire melon.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040148.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Not only was its appearance different than the Hami melons sold in Taiwan, </p>
  <p>round shape and frog-like skin, but also its flesh and flavor which was soft and juicy with the aroma lingering in the mouth.</p>
  <p>Sitting by the roadside to enjoy a whole Ham melon myself, today’s goal was fulfilled.  </p>
  <p>I would just let the rest of the day go by since I was content.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040121.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were always snack bars at the park entrance making demanding kids cry on the ground. Ha, I was an adult with money.</p>
  <p>I bought two ice pops and finished them in front of the jealous kids.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040140.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I stopped by a park where many kids were playing. </p>
  <p>Hami is in Xinjiang Province which takes up one sixth of the China’s territory – Xinjiang is large.</p>
  <p>It borders several countries, such as Russia and Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>Therefore, Xinjiang has people of many other ethnic groups than the Han.</p>
  <p>This little kid on the picture spoke to his mom in a language that I totally do not understand.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040127.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>My ways of evaluating a good city focus on two aspects.</p>
  <p>1. Public Transportation – Hami has many intercity buses and buses routes.</p>
  <p>2. Garbage Cans – the number of the garbage cans reflects public responsibility and it’s attitude to life.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040157.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>From the aspect of my city standards, Hami is outstanding and you would like it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I kept track of every roundabout and turn, but after a while, I still got lost.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040142.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I paid a visit to Hami train station since it was not far.</p>
  <p>The whole city including the train station uses bilingual signs in Chinese and a strange alphabet. </p>
  <p>After asking around, it turned out the strange language was Uyghur.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040160.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I visited 4 or 5 marketplaces today and each had its own characteristic. </p>
  <p>After checking for price, I suddenly felt everything became expensive.</p>
  <p>That was because different units of measurement were used. </p>
  <p>The Chinese pound was not used here, 1 Chinese pound = 500 gram.</p>
  <p>The international System of Units was used here, 1 kilogram = 1000 gram.</p>
  <p>Therefore, everything seemed double in price.</p>
  <p>Many fruit stalls use the same slogan “Melons Available All Four Seasons”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040166.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>I went back to the BBQ restaurant for dinner and enjoyed my life. </p>
  <p>I chatted with Ma Jian Ming, the husband of the restaurant owner’s sister.</p>
  <p>Ma used to be a coal miner working at Sandaoling, a backbreaking job. </p>
  <p>After marrying, he came to Hami and opened up a clay pot restaurant. He also helped out at his brother-in-law’s restaurant by night.</p>
  <p>We were eating grilled fish, grilled tendon, grilled sheep’s hearts, grilled chicken gizzards, and grilled lamb kebab. </p>
  <p>Every skewer was one RMB, so I tried everything with beer happily.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I stocked on snacks before going back to my hotel. Snow cakes, three flavor sandwich crackers, </p>
  <p>eight chocolate pies and a bag of brown sugar would appease my craving for sweets.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I would be leaving city life again tomorrow. The next large city was Shanshan, 300 km away.</p>
  <p>Wouldn’t a vast stretch of desert be waiting for me?</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Time to stock up on supplies, I would knew what to load up on if I imagined what I would like to have for breakfast on the bike. </p>
