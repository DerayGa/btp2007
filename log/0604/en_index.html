  <p class="style5">The fossil of the lake</p>
  <p>Since June, the sunshine is getting stronger everyday when I wake up, while the weather is getting warmer as well. </p>
  <p>Today is still a day with almost no wind. The hot air around me seems concreted.</p>
  <p>Staying in such a dry environment, the sweat is supposed to vaporized before sweat. </p>
  <p>However I’ve been riding sweaty in these days. You can imagine that the sweat is so much.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Finishing the county route 502 in the morning means I’ve left the Sandauling already. </p>
  <p>Connecting back to the national highway 312 and I headed for the destination of today, the Hongshankou.</p>
  <p>Hongshankou is actually a tiny spot which is not even found on the map. </p>
  <p>However, during the ride for more than one hundred kilometers, </p>
  <p>Hongshankou is the only place to provide food and accommodation for me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040289.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I didn’t have my breakfast in downtown.</p>
  <p> I started the trip and ate some chocolate pies and cookies as the breakfast.</p>
  <p>When I flipped my bags for the cookies, I found that the fruit I bought yesterday, </p>
  <p>due to the high temperature, has turned from green…</p>
  <p>…to red and yellow and soft. It is too pity to give up it, so I started eating these over-matured nuts.</p>
  <p>My right hand became sticky after finishing these nuts. </p>
  <p>By the way, It’s not an overcrow, I have no any problem with my stomach after eating these fruits.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are some meaningless white color statues put on the road. Horse, sheep, and dinosaur…</p>
  <p>Although meaningless, I still took a picture for memory.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040294.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had my lunch at the roadside restaurant in which the last human being could be seen before I enter the Tienshan Mountains.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040276.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I ordered a dish of fried pork with bean to match the farina balls. </p>
  <p>Before the food is provided, I used to sit by the door for the wind. But at this moment there was no wind at all.</p>
  <p>Instead, the bothering flies just went on bothering my rest time. So I obediently went back into the restaurant to wait for the food.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040284.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The fried pork with bean was delicious. I felt I haven’t had it for a long time. </p>
  <p>Matching the big and fat farina balls, this lunch is quite good.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040288.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Staying in the restaurant, I was looking at the Dido’s shadow getting shorter under the sunshine. </p>
  <p>The sun was on the top of the sky and the weather was really hot. </p>
  <p>My watch thermometer showed that the current temperature was 37.4 degree centigrade.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The restaurant is not a place to stay for a lifetime.</p>
  <p> I drank all the water in both bottles, and re-filled them up from the restaurant’s hot water bottle.</p>
  <p>I just thought that I’m well prepared, then the boss questioned that the water I bring with me is not enough.</p>
  <p>Oh my god…what kind of the road is that I would be facing? How much water should be “enough” to me?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding forty kilometers of slightly uphill from the restaurant, </p>
  <p>and then a continuous eight kilometers of uphill when I came into the mountains.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040304.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I arrived the top of this section, I could enjoy another continuous eighteen kilometers of downhill.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040320.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The scenery of the uphill and the downhill are beautiful. </p>
  <p>It looks like the portrait, and it expends alongside the national highway. </p>
  <p>The hills on two sides are not quite high, yet the geology is very special. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040330.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are big rocks, desert hills, bluffs and cliffs. My eyes were busy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040354.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040356.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Three departure camels were eating the dry and yellow grass looks hard to eat. </p>
  <p>Ropes tightened their front legs, possibly to prevent them from running too far. A little bit pity.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040316.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The downhill section is more dangerous. The highly loading trucks were running very slow to avoid getting out of the highway.</p>
  <p>So I was overtaking the trucks one by one. I could ride more than fifty kilometers per hour at the fastest. </p>
  <p>The road was well maintained, so it is not afraid to fall off by the holes.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040383.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I heard that the section between Sandauling and Hongshankou is the wind tunnel of Tienshan Mountain. </p>
  <p>However, after a whole day riding, I didn’t feel windy very much. Yet it was really super hot.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040352.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I saw some beautiful scenery and felt not satisfied enough only by stopping the bike to watch it, </p>
  <p>I would hand Dido and left the highway for photos. </p>
  <p>Setting the camera onto the ten second self-timer mode. To catch the moment of my jump precisely, </p>
  <p>I jumped no less than twenty times to get this ordinary picture.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040416.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On the brisk downhill section, I saw a light beige-colored area far from me, which is not matched with the scenery around. </p>
  <p>I thought it was a desert so I rode towards it for fun.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040422.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I came closer to it, I found that it was not the sand. </p>
  <p>Judging from the shape of the edges and from the dry and broken surface, this is just like the fossil of a lake.</p>
  <p>Maybe this place had been a snow water oasis. However it has been dry completely.</p>
  <p> A deep sadness that is not able for any grass to grow up.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040427.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I circled around the dry lake by my bike, looking at the present face of the lake, </p>
  <p>and tried to imagine its clear water and lively in the past.</p>
  <p>We could look at the fossil of the lake, and imagine its manner in the past.</p>
  <p>Just change a point of view. Please look at the environment we live. </p>
  <p>It is still beautiful currently, but its future might be the same with this lake: Dead silence only.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040436.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I raised the “Bike To Protect Our Planet” banner here in this place.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040442.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If this picture really makes any sense to you, please start from yourself and do some thing </p>
  <p>that you wouldn’t regret in the future for the earth, for yourself, and for your beloved families.</p>
  <p>My power is small, and my sound is even smaller. </p>
  <p>But I expect to express my thought to you who live together with me on the planet.</p>
  <p>Let’s care about the issue of the global warming. </p>
  <p>Beyond merely care, you can exploit your influence and action, to help the earth decreasing the temperature.</p>

  <p><img src="photo/P1040443.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I left the lake fossil, I found that I was a little bit stupid to leave the main road this way. </p>
  <p>In order to climb back to the road, I slipped and dropped for several time and spent a long time to go back.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, I saw again something flying by the road with oozing sound. </p>
  <p>It’s again the poor bees left on the desert from the bee’s net on the raisers’ truck. Nick name to be “desert bee”.</p>
  <p>The three bulges on my brow were not flattened yet, while I still remember the big pain at the moment the bees stung me. </p>
  <p>Now the desert bees appeared again! And it was more than last time along the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040417.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Learning from last time, I know that it would be probably fine if I don’t anger them. </p>
  <p>Should I be fine if I just ride and pass them silently?</p>
  <p>Climbing on the sharp ascent which is the last two kilometers to Hongshankou, nevertheless, </p>
  <p>the desert bees noticed me and started flying around me.</p>
  <p>They were oozing and kept hitting everywhere on me. From the face, the head, the eye glasses, </p>
  <p>the ears, the hands, the body, to the legs.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040453.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Although I was panic, I still told myself not to expel them. It would be bad if they were angry again. </p>
  <p>Three or four bees were clambering on me, and I didn’t dare to banish them.</p>
  <p>Just left them clambering on my clothes. To get away from the ascending as soon as possible, </p>
  <p>I couldn’t ride easily, and were pushing hard until my legs felt pain. I arrived the top of the hill in the end, and…</p>
  <p>… tried to slip away from the bees by the higher speed on the descending section. </p>
  <p>The plan worked for a while. The bees couldn’t catch up with me and were all left behind.</p>
  <p>But, during the sliding, I saw the beautiful scenery and I braked hard to stop for photo,</p>
  <p> forgetting that the threat has still not been disengaged.</p>
  <p>The desert bees caught up with me at this moment and surrounded me again. </p>
  <p>They seemed discover my intention to escape, and seemed become more irritable, but luckily I was not stung this time.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040455.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I slided down the slope to the Hongshankou. This is a place no bigger than a peanut, and no wonder it is not indicated on the map.</p>
  <p>A small town like the Xingxingxia could be called a city compared with the Hongshankou.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was shocked by the loud voice of the restaurant staff when I just arrived at Hongshankou.</p>
  <p>The staff waived his hand to call me. I said I would find a place to stay over night and have the dinner later. </p>
  <p>Actually it provides hospitality right here and charges ten dollars each night.</p>
  <p>Finally I could hide into a house to stay away from the annoying desert bees. </p>
  <p>I told the staff that there are lots of bees and they sting, so please put me into the house as soon as possible.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040496.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But, since I was with Dido, I wasn’t able to get in the front door, and had to detour by the back door.</p>
  <p>The staff said “It’s OK. The bees don’t sting” with ease.” But right after his words…</p>
  <p>”Ouch! It hurts!” A damn bee stung my left ear again. It really hurts, so I pasted the bee with its thorn left on my ear.</p>
  <p>The staff saw me stung and realized that this is not kidding, </p>
  <p>and then called me to get in the house with Dido by the back door. I rushed into the house and disengaged the crisis.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I used to think that wild dogs are the major threat to bike tourists, and I even took the injection to prevent from the rabies.</p>
  <p>The result was unpredictable and I have been stung by the bees for four bulges already. </p>
  <p>That pain, if I could give a solid expression, is just a kind of burning feel like a fire-heated wire penetrating into the body.</p>
  <p>One more sting, I would definitely look for the mosquito net cap that the bee raisers wear when I go to the town.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This restaurant and hotel is pretty cool that the room is small and basically clean. But there is no power supply until the night.</p>
  <p>In the dark room, the only lighting is a hole on the ceiling to derive the sunlight.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040473.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I flipped my bags and took the socks out that I washed yesterday and put in a plastic bag, </p>
  <p>to air-dry them since it was still a bit wet. The socks were warm when I took them out.</p>
  <p>The digital camera has been warm for the whole day. I didn’t get the heat stroke in such a hot weather. </p>
  <p>The idea of packing me like a bank robber seems not bad.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I took the ewer and towel, and asked for some water to mop my sweat sticky body. </p>
  <p>There is no water faucet here, and the water is reserved in the water tank. I asked if this water comes from the well or the snow.</p>
  <p>The answer is that the water is not from the local source, and is actually bought. </p>
  <p>Driving trucks to buy water and carry it back here, the water here is rare.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040482.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I scooped half-full of the ewer. Exercised for a few days, </p>
  <p>now half an ewer of water is enough to clean the whole body, plus washing my head.</p>
  <p>Another half ewer of water could treat from the relatively clean headscarf down to the socks, to wash the sweat and sand away.</p>
  <p>Totally a ewer of water can finish all the refreshing and laundry, while the remaining water can be used to knead the dirty shoes. </p>
  <p>Not any drop of water would be wasted.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040490.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The logistics is quite difficult in such far places. Anywhere else is more than one hundred kilometers from Hongshankou, </p>
  <p>and thus the product pricing here is relatively higher.</p>
  <p>It should be this way. I fully understand that the prices of the coke in downtown and in the desert should be different. </p>
  <p>And I’m glad to let the hotel staff to earn that money.</p>
  <p>The weak small light finally lighted up after nine o’clock in the night. </p>
  <p>Many of my equipments have to work normally by recharging, </p>
  <p>and no power supply is actually the same troublesome like no water to drink.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040502.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are some raised chickens walking around outside, and there are two timid kitties in the house. </p>
  <p>I put a lot of effort to wheedle them out of the house for photo.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040488.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had my dinner of egg-fried rice and the twice-cooked pork here. The staff all come from Chungching. </p>
  <p>I came for the dinner at nine thirty p.m. and I thought I was late. Actually I was the first one to have the dinner.</p>
  <p>At this time the sun was just about to set. The sky was still bright and it was really not like 9:30 p.m. </p>
  <p>I asked them when they normally take their dinners.</p>
  <p>They just answered, “It’s still very early!” Their exact dinnertime is still unknown.</p>
  <p>Adding the pickled bean into the twice-cooked pork, it tasted quite salty. </p>
  <p>After a sweat day, I took this chance to get some salt back. I combined the sauce in the fried rice and finished them all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040503.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After the dinner I wipe some mentholatum ointment on my left ear as well as the brow. </p>
  <p>Tomorrow I am supposed to arrive the big city “Shanshan”. I hope there will be no more bee attack. God bless me.</p>
