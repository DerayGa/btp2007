  <p class="style5">You! Wind! You win!</p>
  <p>I guess God granted my wish of having a cool weather. </p>
  <p>The heavy cloud provided a great shed, and turned the Sun from a fierce tiger to a cute little kitty.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040637.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I'd better bike faster for now, because my destination today is Turpan, the lowest point, also the hottest place in China </p>
  <p>( Note: Turpan Depression is the second lowest exposed point on Earth, next to Dead Sea).</p>
  <p>Since it is the lowest point, it was pretty easy for me, I just let go downhill most of the time. </p>
  <p>With the help of the weather, even passing the burning Flaming Mountains area was not too bad anymore.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040668.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040671.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040679.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Flaming Mountains was magnificent, and humongous. There was nothing grown on it, though, no wonder it's called Flaming Mountains.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040687.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Enjoying the view, I effortlessly passed this entrance of the &quot;Red Mountain&quot;, which was famous with its windy weather.  </p>
  <p>I thought I was pretty lucky today.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040700.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>You can see lots of watermelons, Hami melons and raisins on sale along the way to Turpan.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040641.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040720.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Hmmmm…. I wondered what are these mud-structured THINGs? </p>
  <p>Tens of thousands of them built in such a barren area. </p>
  <p>(Note by the translator: These weird structures are used to air-dry grapes to make raisins)</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040644.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Well, I had already seen the best part of Flaming Mountains. No need to spend money for the tour again, I guess.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040711.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I arrived at Turpan City at noon, much earlier than I expected.  It is only 180 km away from Urumqi at this point.</p>
  <p>Originally I thought it would take me two days from Turpan to Urumqi. </p>
  <p>Since I was ahead of the schedule, I could bike a bit further this afternoon, so I can definitely enter Urumqi by tomorrow.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had my lunch at the truck rest area before entering Turpan. </p>
  <p>I really loved the Islamic food, and I ordered a stir-fried noodle and a meatball soup, Islamic style, both were exquisite. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040721.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After resting for half an hour, I took off again.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040727.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040728.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&quot;Welcome to Turpan&quot;, my destination for today. Time to look for a hotel?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040730.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Turpan is also famous for its vine yard.  Most grapes were small but seemed ripe, ready to make wine.</p>
  <p>There is a vine yard opened to tourists, rated four stars in China.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040737.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was a wonderful idea to take advantage of the trellis-climbing grapes.  </p>
  <p>Not only they were beautiful to look at, they also provided an excellent shade. </p>
  <p>Most importantly, fruitful grapes were growing as great as they can be.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040739.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Five-cent ice cream! Tasted like watermelon flavor, very yummy.</p>
  <p>The boss was a Uyghur, so I said &quot;Lah-huh-may-teh&quot;(meaning &quot;Thank you&quot;) to show my appreciation to his ice cream in this hot hot day.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040741.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Wandering in the urban area until 3:30, I decided to continue on Rt 312. </p>
  <p>My plan was to move another 20-30 km, to make tomorrow an even easier ride.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>BUT…</p>
  <p>I did not take it serious about the windy situation from Turpan to Urumqi, </p>
  <p>especially the famous 30 km that was VERY windy, up to Force 12.</p>
  <p>Before I entered the famous windy area, I did see the sign &quot;No Bicycle&quot;. </p>
  <p>As you can imagine, of course I totally ignored it. </p>
  <p>Didn't you see me ride my Dido on every highway so far? What made this different from rest of the highways in China?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, let me tell you why. It is IMPOSSIBLE to ride a bike on this part of the National Highway.</p>
  <p>Luckily, I got through the first 4 km by hiding behind a tricycle carrying piles of stuff.</p>
  <p>After that, I was on my own.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040747.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Struggling, I managed to ride the bike little by little, but wobbling very badly at the same time. </p>
  <p>Because there was no shoulder, and I was not able to steer my bike as I normally do. </p>
  <p>I had to occupy the whole lane of the highway.</p>
  <p>All the cars passed me dared NOT to honk, either. They just tried their best to pass by me safely. </p>
  <p>I guessed they were very sacred of bumping me, or got bumped by me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After officially entering the windy area, I could not even maintain my balance on the bike. </p>
  <p>This got to be the strongest wind I had ever encountered in my whole life.  </p>
  <p>Compare to this, the Typhoons we had in Taiwan were just a piece of cake.</p>
  <p>At the beginning, I was very excited and yelling, </p>
  <p>&quot;Come! Come! Let me see what else can you do?&quot; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Around 5:00 in the afternoon, I knew there was no way I can continue to ride on the bike. </p>
  <p>I WALKED with my bike instead. But even that was extremely difficult, </p>
  <p>with wind came in from all directions except the one that can make my life easier. </p>
  <p>After a while, I can't even walk with my bike. I had to lean on Dido with my waist and right foot, </p>
  <p>and my left foot standing like a tilted A-shape with my body. </p>
  <p>And this wired gesture could merely allow me to STAND with Dido in the wind. </p>
  <p>How could I move forward, then?</p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/G36o4bYG2uQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This wind was not only fast and strong, but also very dry.  I constantly had tears in my eyes. </p>
  <p>My saliva was blown out of my mouth anytime I opened my mouth.</p>
  <p>Just when I thought I had the worst wind ever,</p>
  <p> I kept encountering the stronger and stronger wind every inch I move forward.</p>
  <p>I lowered my head while walking with Dido, the wind blew away my sun glasses within 1/10 sec,and it fell on the ground within half a sec.</p>
  <p>Of course I would want to get it back since it was the only pair of sun glasses </p>
  <p>with corrected vision I had with me. But there was just no chance at all that I could do it. </p>
  <p>I had to watch my sun glasses &quot;gone with the wind&quot; for the next 3 sec. </p>
  <p>It rolled on the graveled road, downhill a bit, crossed to the other side of the road, and then disappeared, just like that, in front of me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I started feeling scared by now. If the wind can take away my glasses on my head, </p>
  <p>and I had to struggle so badly just to keep Dido by my side standing. Can I really walk this part through?</p>
  <p>With no option, I told Dido,&quot; Don't worry. We will get through this together&quot;.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It took me 30 min to advance less than 1 km. </p>
  <p>I even felt my clothes were going to torn apart by the wind,</p>
  <p> like the man in the Aesop's Fable, &quot;The Wind and the Sun&quot;, when he was facing the Wind's challenge.</p>
  <p>I planned to walk like this until 9:00, if the situation was not improving and I could not find a place to stay, </p>
  <p>I would hide into some area under the bridges for a night.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I didn't try to hitchhike, I just continue walked with Dido.</p>
  <p>Honestly, with wind blowing like this, I couldn't move much at all if without Dido, I probably could not even stand still for more than 3 sec. </p>
  <p>Leaning on Dido actually helped me lower my barycenter, also added the weight on me. </p>
  <p>So even the progress was very slow, at least I was making some.</p>
  <p>I told myself that I would not ask for help, I would not hitchhike at any point. I can make it, I really can.</p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Cd08Wyl_9Yk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So, here I was, walking like this, from 5-9. My hands were so sore by holding the bike very tightly in the wind.</p>
  <p>It reminded me the time when I was in the military service training. </p>
  <p>I was a MP (Military Police), and sometimes serviced in the motorcycle escort group. </p>
  <p>Before we can proudly ride on this 1300c.c. motorcycle, we had to be able to run with it (not ON it),like the way I was walking with Dido.</p>
  <p>Yamaha Royal-star was the motorcycle on the force at that time. </p>
  <p>It weights 347 kg with the empty tank, so you can imagine how exhausted it was to run with this monster.</p>
  <p>Well, now please move the camera back to ME walking (barely) with my Dido, </p>
  <p>which weighted over 50 kg with all the bags but felt like heavier than that Yamaha Royal-star, against a windy weather like this. </p>
  <p>No wonder the sign said, &quot;No Bicycle&quot;. However, even if I was well aware of this windy situation, </p>
  <p>I would still come up to face this challenge.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After 9, still no sign of any city/town, I was starting to look for a place to crash for tonight.</p>
  <p>I looked around with my eyes filled with tears—by the wind, and I saw a truck parked around 200 meters away from me.</p>
  <p>I knew, right at that moment, he was sent to save my life.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although it was only 200 m away, it took me and Dido about 5 min to get there.</p>
  <p>The driver looked pretty young, </p>
  <p>&quot;You have such an impeccable timing. Today is one of the worst days on this road. Come on now&quot;, he said.</p>
  <p>We were 1 meter apart, but we had to yell to each other.</p>
  <p> As if the words we said were blown away by this wind as soon as they left our mouth.</p>
  <p>I stood by the truck and asked if there was any place to spend the night around here.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not within 10 km.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wind become gentler if I continue on this road?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;It will only get worse. The wind will blow at you from the side or against you. It is impossible to pass that, if you walk with the bike&quot;</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040757.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Well, I got my answers, I surrendered—for now.  I loaded all the bags into the truck, then the Dido.</p>
  <p>The driver asked me where I was heading, I said &quot;Urumqi&quot;. </p>
  <p>&quot;I was riding ON my bike since day one of this trip, and I am very proud of it. </p>
  <p>I wouldn't get into your car if not for this windy situation.  I really appreciate your kindness, but I really wish I can overcome this by myself&quot;.</p>
  <p>His name is Baisong Chiang. He carried a truck full of watermelons from Turpan to sell at Urumqi, so he offered to give me a ride to Urumqi.</p>
  <p>&quot;How long can we arrive at Dabancheng? I think I can ride from there to Urumqi myself&quot;.</p>
  <p>&quot;It is also very windy from Dabancheng to Urumqi. What if you got stuck there again? Why not let me take you all the way to Urumqi&quot;.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040760.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Baisong was younger than me by 2 years. He has already married and with a baby.</p>
  <p>I was very happy for him when he talked about his kid.</p>
  <p>Sitting inside the truck, which was also greatly affected by the wind, I saw the beautiful sight through the window, </p>
  <p>feeling very disappointed that I was not able to bike Dido through this part of my journey.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Baisong is an interesting person, and he likes to have his freedom, just like me. He was from Henan province, </p>
  <p>but he left home to Turpan to be independent by the age of 15. </p>
  <p>He didn't like to work for others, so he learned to open his own business. </p>
  <p>Baisong doesn't make a lot of money, but he gets to work for himself, and manages to support his own family. </p>
  <p>Other than transporting melons, he also grows Hami melons with some farmers. </p>
  <p>They calculate the time so that when the melons are ready for fall harvest, </p>
  <p>which is around mid August, their Hami melons would be the only ones available on the market in China. </p>
  <p>These melons are sent to Beijing to sell and make extra 70-80,000 RMB for each of them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040762.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When we passed the tollbooth, I asked Baisong if I can pay for the toll.  </p>
  <p>He said it was not a big deal at all. We are friends, and that's what friends are for.</p>
  <p>I mentioned Dabancheng earlier, so Baisong detoured to show me the city. </p>
  <p>He said, because of the famous folks song, &quot;The girls from Dabancheng&quot;, </p>
  <p>everybody wants to come here to visit this city at least once in his life time, but,</p>
  <p>&quot;You will regret for the rest of your life if you never get a chance to visit. </p>
  <p>But after you visit, you will regret for the rest of your life that you ever get a chance to visit&quot;.</p>
  <p>However, I still asked Baisong to drop me off here. </p>
  <p>Maybe the road ahead is as difficult as he said, but I wanted to give it another try. I wanted to BIKE to Urumqi by myself.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I really appreciated Baisong's kindness and help, so that I did not have to sleep under some bridge of some sort.  </p>
  <p>There is nothing I can say to express my gratitude, especially his &quot;That's what friends are for&quot;; I will always remember that, Baisong. Thank you.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040764.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After around 50 km later, we arrived at Dabancheng at 10:00 at night. </p>
  <p>The first thing was to look for a place to sleep, and I found one with 8 RMB a night.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040768.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The lady said it was raining at Urumqi, that's why on the way to Dabancheng was having such a big storm. </p>
  <p>She wondered what the weather would be like tomorrow.</p>
  <p>The boss, on the other hand, was pretty drunk already. </p>
  <p>He kept threatening me that he would call police to arrest me if I can't show him my ID. </p>
  <p>I asked him to go to sleep early and I will have some drink with him tomorrow.</p>
  <p>The 8 RMB room was not too bad, except it was a bit far away from bathroom and water fountain.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040766.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The second thing on my list was, dinner.</p>
  <p>I found a BBQ restaurant nearby.  Like everybody else here, I also ordered a yogurt-like drink, </p>
  <p>it was called &quot;sour milk&quot; in Chinese, but it was not sour at all. Added some sugar, it tasted pretty good, actually.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040769.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then the real food was here, BBQ meat and cold beer. I was having time of my life.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040772.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Right there, I told myself, if the weather is bad tomorrow, I shall stay in Dabancheng for one more day. </p>
  <p>If the weather is really good tomorrow, I shall also stay in Dabancheng for one more day.</p>
  <p>My philosophy is: I will have great moments to remember this trip by if I take it slow once a while when the &quot;place&quot; is right. </p>
  <p>Otherwise, all I can talk about when I am old will be how many miles I accumulated everyday on my GPS tracker in this whole entire trip.  </p>
  <p>What's the point then?</p>
