  <p class="style5">The Dabancheng Girl</p>
  <p>It was bliss to stay in the cool town of Dabancheng one more day.</p>
  <p>The city guide said that the town was very accessible, 90 km away from either Urumqi or Turpan</p>
  <p>(Note: Urumqi is also known as Urumchi, or Ürümchi)</p>
  <p>Is it very accessible if a place is 90 km from its adjacent cities? </p>
  <p>Because of the “accessibility”, Danbancheng had become a quiet place and a nice summer retreat.</p>
  <p>A bowel of shaozi noodles was my initial order at my breakfast restaurant. </p>
  <p>Then I saw some yummy-looking flatbread on the next table, and ordered that as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040776.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was a green onion pancake with a side dish of lightly seasoned julienne cucumber, julienne daikon and sliced onion. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040774.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since the milk tea they offered was not Tibetan yak butter tea, I skipped it.</p>
  <p>I reconfirmed my route to Urumqi with the cook in the breakfast restaurant and made sure that I could ride through.</p>
  <p>“On the whole, it is not an easy ride. It is not as bad as the famous 『30 km wind gap』 though, </p>
  <p>you should be able to make it if you do it in the morning when the wind has not picked up”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The market place had been very busy in the morning and seemed to remain busy for the rest of the day – I would check it out later then.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040780.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Milk calves were traded in the market. A sold calf was dragged away from the old owner. </p>
  <p>Apparently she did not want to leave the old owner.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040782.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then, I went back to the guest house and walked Dido out. </p>
  <p>The guest house had only a small signboard outside. However, it had a spacious court yard inside and my room was in the corner. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040895.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were many broad bean stores in Dabancheng. Broad beans are a local specialty of Dabancheng.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040790.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Dabancheng also had vast precious grassland where animals were grazing, and produced a large quantity of milk. </p>
  <p>It was very different than the surrounding barren mountains.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040832.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Dwj4GT3DCy0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>Therefore, you can understand that milk tea and yogurt are sold at the stores here. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040822.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Luckily, today was Friday when the weekly market was held with a variety of vendors. I happily enjoyed the busy thriving market.</p>
  <p>At 2:00pm, I started touring Dabancheng on Dido and first rode toward an attraction spot, the old town.</p>
  <p>Grassland – long time no see! The rapeseed flowers were waving in the wind.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040809.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The same raging wind like yesterday was at my back today and blew me forward.</p>
  <p> I did not need to push the pedals but controlled the handlebar and the brake.</p>
  <p>The trees bent in the wind. Which mountain did the gale come from?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040795.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The old town was not far – 10 minutes ride. I just wanted to take a look at the old town at the gate. </p>
  <p>Since the entrance fee was inexpensive and bicycles were allowed, I paid for the ticket and took the tour.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040836.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040842.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040887.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Dabancheng was built a thousand years ago dating back to the Tang dynasty. </p>
  <p>Everything was either damaged during the war, or lost with the passing of time, except for its city wall.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040848.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This old town was actually the carefully renovated White Water town located outside of Dabancheng.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040850.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040851.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Only a few houses were in the little old town, but each one had its own character, with souvenirs and local specialties for sale. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040854.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040857.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As the matter of fact, I never heard the famous song “The Dabancheng Girl” before. </p>
  <p>Even with the lyrics and score in front of me, I did not know how to sing it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040861.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While I was trying to sing the song, the winery owner invited me over. </p>
  <p>I had a glass of red wine which had very low alcohol content and tasted like grape juice – not bad though.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040863.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040866.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>By the way, I asked the owner to play “The Dabancheng Girl” for me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mr. Wang Luobin collected and revised this folk song of Uygur. Here are the lyrics:</p>
  <p>“Dabancheng’s stone roads are hard and smooth</p>
  <p>Water melons are big and sweet </p>
  <p>The girls live there having long braids and beautiful eyes.</p>
  <p>If you want to get married, don’t marry other man.</p>
  <p>You must marry me</p>
  <p>Bring your million dollar dowry and take your young sister with you</p>
  <p>Come to me in a carriage”</p>
  <p>Accompanied by guitar, this is a happy folk song. </p>
  <p>It sounded funny the first time I listened to it, but it lightened my heart after several replays.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040868.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Dido was left with the winery owner and the staff of the Wang Luobin memorial hall </p>
  <p>as I was browsing through the memorial hall to learn who Wang Luobin was.</p>
  <p>Thanks to him who revised so many Xinjiang folk songs, we are left with lots of good songs including the famous “The Dabancheng Girl”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040870.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I told the winery owner that I never heard the song and asked him to play it for me, </p>
  <p>he was shocked – how could it be possible not to have heard it as a Chinese?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The lyrics say water melons are big and sweet in Dabancheng, Dabancheng does not  grow them.</p>
  <p>Broad beans are the major agricultural product here. </p>
  <p>They are processed and made into snacks with various flavors such as garlic, spicy, strawberry or fruit.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040873.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The old town has a broad bean shop as well.</p>
  <p>Just like Harry Potter’s Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, there were various flavored broad beans sold here and there was one named “strange flavor”. </p>
  <p>I asked the lady owner if it was for real before sampling it with my eyes closed.</p>
  <p>It tasted like BBQ lamb kabob and the flavor was not strange at all.</p>
  <p> I bought a small bag of fruit flavored beans - crispy, tasty and nutritious.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After thousands of years, only the city wall ruin was left. </p>
  <p>The ruin was not protected by anything, but enclosed with rope.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040882.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Perhaps the town would be gone forever in a thousand years, </p>
  <p>or some unbelievable technology would rebuild the town. Who knows?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There were a few real tents, plank wood trails with weeds sticking out from the joints and a spring named “bringing baby”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040881.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The cold, gusty wind ruffled my hair. My hair had grown long during the trip and was getting harder to deal with.</p>
  <p>I would get a buzz cut after getting back to Dabancheng.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040890.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I dropped in the hair saloon next door to my guest house and had the hairdresser cut my hair without asking the price.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040897.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had a hair wash first, then I was asked about hairstyle.</p>
  <p>“buzz cut, but don’t shave me bald”</p>
  <p>10 minutes later, my haircut was done. I felt fresh and delightful when touching the short hair.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040900.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>During the haircut, I chatted with the local hairdresser. It turned out that the locals do not eat broad beans.</p>
  <p>Then, who would eat them?</p>
  <p>It turns out that the broad beans were not sold for the locals, but for whom then?</p>
  <p>“For You!” said the hairdresser with laugh on her face.</p>
  <p>She said that Dabancheng was a boring place with nothing to do </p>
  <p>and people did not make much money and had no place to spend it either.</p>
  <p>Isn’t that good? Don’t worry about having no money, because there is no place to spend it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Wearing my new hairstyle, I went to the market place before it was closed. </p>
  <p>The weekly market place was busy and surely an event for Dabancheng.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040902.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I bought a big bag of cracker-like puffs - one RMB only. </p>
  <p>“What they are?” I asked</p>
  <p>“Popcorn!” said the owner.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040909.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>What? They were popcorns! Shouldn’t the popcorn flakes are white in ball-shape?</p>
  <p>Never mind, even if they were not “popcorn”, I had nothing to lose. </p>
  <p>Slightly sweetened popcorn on the go - I shared them with the cute little kids in the market.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040918.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Clothes, hardware and groceries were not what I needed, what interested me always was food.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040921.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Here is some deep-fried cake with sugar paste filling – sweet and yummy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040924.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The kid with the deep-fried cake stall surprised me greatly.</p>
  <p>“Uncle, are you traveling on bicycle?” he burst out.</p>
  <p>Wow, very clever! How did you know? Did I bump into you on the road?</p>
  <p>The smart kid saw the tan lines around my fingers to figure out that I was traveling on bike.</p>
  <p>“You go, smart kid. One day you will be somebody”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040907.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Please take a look! They are some cute Dabancheng girls having long braids and beautiful eyes – super kawaii.</p>
  <p>[Note: kawaii is Japanese means cute]</p>
  <p>~girls, I am sharing my popcorn with you~</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040930.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even though Dabancheng does not grow water melons, it was quite an experience to eat a water melon there.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040904.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The watermelon man was a Uyghur, his melons were super cheap. </p>
  <p>The most expensive watermelon I ever had was in Xian – 3 RMB for one Chinese pound (or 500 g).</p>
  <p>The most inexpensive watermelon was in Dabancheng – 2.5 RMB for one melon (2.5 kg), one sixth of the Xian price.</p>
  <p>The watermelons from Turpan have fewer seeds than the melons in Xian. </p>
  <p>They are super sweet and have dark green rind with no jagged stripes</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040940.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>He carefully picked a melon of the right size for one person. </p>
  <p>I was watching the crowds in the busy market while enjoying the sweet melon.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some strange looking vegetables were sold at the market, </p>
  <p>such as super large purple onions, greenish daikons, purplish daikons, and large green chili peppers which were seen in every dish.</p>
  <p>I thought the chili pepper was a bell pepper, so I bit down. Man, it was super hot!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040931.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Dinner was braised beef over rice at the restaurant in the market. Chinese food was delicious and was my kind of food.</p>
  <p>Moreover, Chinese food and Taiwanese food are quite alike. Even being out in China for more than forty days, </p>
  <p>I did not miss Taiwanese food to the degree that I could not sleep but looked forward to some new delicacy every day. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040945.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had a great time in Dabancheng today, eating good food and seeing beautiful scenery. </p>
  <p>Tomorrow morning I would manage to get up early and be off to Urumqi before the wind started picking up.</p>
