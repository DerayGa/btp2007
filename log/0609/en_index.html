  <p class="style5">The pride of Xinjiang </p>
  <p>I originally planed to depart at 6 AM to avoid the strong head wind. This way I may hit Urumchi before noon. </p>
  <p>To make this plan work, I can not just lie in bed till noon time. </p>
  <p>Therefore I slept earlier last night right after I finished my dinner. </p>
  <p>The wind blew hard during the night. The sound of rustling leaves in the wind never stopped. </p>
  <p>I thought that the wind was only strong during the day, how come it is so restless tonight? </p>
  <p>Just like the typhoon nights back in Taiwan, I closed my eyes and tried to sleep despite the howling sound of wind. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Next day, the wind was still blowing hard. The temperature was as low as ten something degrees Celsius. </p>
  <p>I opened the door and looked outside. It rained hard last night, and the ground was still wet. </p>
  <p>The heavy and dark clouds are moving toward the east with the wind. This is a windy and rainy day. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>What do I do? My plan of early departure will not work now. </p>
  <p>If the weather keeps on raging, I even doubt that I can leave here today. <img src="photo/P1040956.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>With no solution in sight, I end up reading in the room. </p>
  <p>Hopefully the sky will clear after sometime, or I might need to stay at Dawanching for one more day. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>About 9 AM, the sunshine finally broke out of the clouds. </p>
  <p>The strong wind has taken the dark cloud to the south-eastern side, and the blue sky begins to recover in the north-western side. </p>
  <p>“Time to Go! Let's hit the road, Dido!” </p>
  <p>I said goodbye to the hotel owner, who threatened me to call the police when I do not show him my ID, </p>
  <p>and also said goodbye to this adorable town, Dawanching. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040955.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Now that the rain has stopped, however, the head wind was still strong. </p>
  <p>Dido and I were wagging in the wind, the effort of trying to keep in a straight line was totally in vain. </p>
  <p>On my right side, I can see the snowy Mountain that is almost too beautiful to exist. </p>
  <p>I try hard to support Dido from being blown onto the ground. </p>
  <p>Holding my breath, I try to print this magnificent view of the nature into my mind. </p>
  <p>The wind is chilling, but the air is fresh. I take a deep breath to fill the cool air into every cell of my lungs. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040971.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>From the first step on the pedal, the head wind and side wind never stops. I try hard to achieve this ridiculous 6 KpH speed. </p>
  <p>This is almost as slow as walking. However, I convince myself to keep on pedaling. </p>
  <p>Once I step down and start walking Dido, there is no way I can start pedaling again. </p>
  <p>The distance between Dawanching and Urumchi is only 90 kilometer long. </p>
  <p>I was planning to leave early in the morning and arrive at noon. But with the head wind, </p>
  <p>I have only achieved a little more than 40 KM starting from 9:30 AM to 4 PM. </p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nGkWpFDAeZI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I don't know what has gotten into me. I did not stop for meals all along the way. </p>
  <p>There are several stops along the road, which provides shelter and food, but I did not stop at any of these shops. </p>
  <p>Kick in the pedal and biting my teeth, I said no to the staffs in restaurants and slowly moved forward on the road. </p>
  <p>From the point of view of the passerby, they might find me funny. </p>
  <p>It seems I am working my ass off pedaling the bike, but I proceed like a movie in slow motion. </p>
  <p>This may look like some kind of silent film, but I am almost killing myself. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I slowly pass by a place called Yiancheng (Salt City) around noon. People said that this place is the Dead Sea of China </p>
  <p>Therefore, the highlight of this place is something like floating in salt lake or mud spa. </p>
  <p>I am totally not interested in these things and only want to eat something to refill my energy. </p>
  <p>However, I still didn't stop for any food. I kept on moving on the bike. One by one, the signs of restaurants pass me by. </p>
  <p>Maybe it is because deep down I know it would be really difficult to start pedaling again after I stopped in this kind of wind. </p>
  <p>I choose not to stop at all. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Slowly, I arrived at a small town. This place may seem totally beaten, but I got this feeling, it may be a very lively place in the past. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040984.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But now that there is nothing left here. Not even restaurants. </p>
  <p>The sole shop left in this place has nothing besides instant noodle and drinks. </p>
  <p>I bought a coke here, and started eating my own cookies at the door. That is my lunch for today. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1040987.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After I finished the food, I still feel nothing in my stomach. </p>
  <p>Is it not an illusion that I just ate something? </p>
  <p>Walking back into the shop, I bought a pack of instant noodles and made it with the hot water in the shop. </p>
  <p>A small guy suddenly showed up while I was waiting for my noodles to be ready. </p>
  <p>He is only 18 month old and is totally adorable. As his parents both work at Urumuchi and do not come back everyday, </p>
  <p>this child was separated from his parent at this age. </p>
  <p>I ran to Dido and find out a pack of chocolate which costs one dollar a pack from the bag. I hand him the chocolate. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050008.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>He is not afraid of strangers at all, and is really cute when he sticks to my side. Even though he doesn't speak yet, </p>
  <p>but he is already very charming with the big rolling eyes. </p>
  <p>The grandma says that this is the first time he has ever eaten chocolate. </p>
  <p>I helped him unwrapp the chocolate and watched him slowly eating it. </p>
  <p>One does not need to teach a child how to eat their candy; they were born with this knowledge. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I chat with the shop lady while consuming the noodle. </p>
  <p>It turns out that this beaten town used to be a train station. It used to have its glorious time.</p>
  <p>However, that is one turned page now. Today, neither passenger nor cargo train stops here. </p>
  <p>The town slowly died to what it looks like today. </p>
  <p>I asked another question which concerns me more. </p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wind be as strong as now all the way to Urmuchi?&quot;</p>
  <p>The shop lady says that Urmuchi is not a windy city. Just keep on going for more than 10 kilometers, the wind will die down a bit.</p>
  <p>This news excites me more than hitting a small jackpot! After only 10 kilometers or so, my suffering will be over!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since the shop lady did not state the exact distance, I will assume it is 15 kilometers from here.</p>
  <p>I said goodbye with the kid, start crawling at 6 KpH on the bike again. </p>
  <p>It was merely 15 kilometer and it took me two and a half hours to get there. This is unimaginably slow.</p>
  <p>And the crawling did not lead me to any destination. No town, no shop, nothing like what the shop lady said. </p>
  <p>She said that there will be a town that allows me to have some food and rest.</p>
  <p>Even more disappointing, the wind blows as hard as ever. I even have the feeling that it is getting stronger and stronger. </p>
  <p>The head wind will randomly change its direction, it either blows me off the road or pushes me to the passing cars.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I saw something yellow far away at my side around 3 o'clock. It looks like a lake, but I am not certain of it since it is too far away.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050016.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since I am only crawling now, it won't hurt to see what that is. </p>
  <p>I walk Dido to the direction. It is too dangerous to put Dido just aside the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050019.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After the road gets really bumpy, I decide to hide Dido and walk there myself.</p>
  <p>This is a beautiful grassland, and filled with various kinds of... dung. This place must be filled with cattle.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050021.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The weather is cool, around 25 degrees Celsius. The wind blows on the grassland, and the sheep cling to each other trying to keep warm. </p>
  <p>They will eat the grass and sleep side by side, quite adorable.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050040.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>These sheep are not afraid of strangers at all. If I try to walk like a cat, even if I am just standing by them they will not run away. </p>
  <p>They will just glance at me and keep on biting the grass.</p>
  <p>Some of they are almost naked. I guess they should be sheep.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050049.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I feel a bit sorry that I have been eating mutton since I arrived at Xinjiang. You sheep are not only adorable but also delicious..</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This guy is the owner of the sheep. All of these sheep belongs to him. The little guy is his child. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050075.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I continue my adventure and walk to the lake. </p>
  <p>All these different plants have their own territories, it is almost like someone has separated them with a line.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050031.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050053.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As I get closer to the lakeshore, I am more certain that this is a lake. </p>
  <p>The wave keeps on splashing on the shore, and this lake is even more yellow then the yellow river</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050062.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The sheep owner says the reason of the yellowness is because of the wind. </p>
  <p>The wind blows on the lake and makes the water go round. This brings the mud up and turns the water yellow.</p>
  <p>When the wind dies down, the lake will be crystal clear, you won't see even a sand in it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050063.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since the wind is blowing hard, the wave is also very high. </p>
  <p>If I didn't already know that this was a lake, I would guess that I was at a coastline.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050068.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I walked along the lakeshore towards the sheep at the other side and took some pictures. </p>
  <p>It was at this time I found out that I forgot where I hid Dido.</p>
  <p>This is quite a large grassland, and I hid Dido pretty well. It really took me a while before I found Dido.</p>
  <p>When I saw Dido, I draw a circle in the air with my hands. I tell him that there are a lot of sheep at this place.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050078.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then I waveed my hand and said that there was a large lake just ahead, </p>
  <p>and the waves are so high that it looks just like the waves of the sea.</p>
  <p>Talking to Dido has already become my habit. </p>
  <p>I will share what I have in mind with Dido; it could be what I saw or what I just ate, or whatever that comes across my mind.</p>
  <p>Normally the first sentence I say everyday is &quot;Morning Dido&quot;, </p>
  <p>and when I start the journey of the day, I will say &quot;Let's go Dido!&quot;</p>
  <p>Dido is a reliable friend. It carries all my baggage and me all along the way. But when it's my turn to carry it upstairs, </p>
  <p>which is a rare thing, I murmur that &quot;you are really heavy.. Have you ever considered losing some weight?&quot;. </p>
  <p>But all the weight it gained is due to the snacks I bought along the way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I left the lake around four thirty. Now it is still 50 kilometers from Urumchi</p>
  <p>If the head wind keeps on blowing and I keep on going at 6 KpH, by the time I arrive at Urumchi it will be midnight.</p>
  <p>It was after sometime before I arrived at the town that the shop lady mentioned.</p>
  <p> It is actually more than twenty kilometers, not just more than ten kilometers.</p>
  <p>At this time I should be getting my dinner not my lunch. But I still ignore the shops and eat nothing.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050099.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I bought two local ice cream stick in a store, and asked the &quot;Frequently Asked Question&quot;. </p>
  <p>&quot;Will it be this windy all the way to Urumchi?&quot;</p>
  <p>No one is confident enough to give me an exact answer. </p>
  <p>Some say it is this windy all the way,and some say after I cross the wind turbine farm, the wind will not be as strong.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050101.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The speed of the head wind will be the deciding factor if I will arrive at Urumchi at midnight or dawn. I better keep on going.</p>
  <p>Urumchi is so close, but it is so difficult to get there. The last part of my journey in China is not at all easy.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Soon after I leave the town, the wind turbines appear. </p>
  <p>As a rough estimate, there might be more than ten thousand turbines. </p>
  <p>This makes sense; it would be a shame not to have these turbines at this windy place.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050129.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>They can put this up all the way to Turpan. And especially the thirty-mile wind gap. </p>
  <p>The wind there is so strong; the turbines might even be blown apart. </p>
  <p>The last time I saw these wind mills was when I was still in Gansu. </p>
  <p>Since there are a lot of oil fields in Xinjiang, they never have the problem of energy shortage. </p>
  <p>It is a good thing to see them utilizing the green way to gather energy.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since the wind turbine farm is so massive and beautiful, </p>
  <p>there are even couples-to-be coming to this place to take pictures for their wedding portfolio.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050116.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The guys in the store said that the wind will not be as strong soon after I pass this wind turbine farm. </p>
  <p>Although they are not very confident about this, I still grabbed this hope tightly and kept on going.</p>
  <p>The wind did not just stop like what I wished. As I rode into the mountain area and climbed over the hills, I am about 25 kilometer outside Urumchi. </p>
  <p>The head wind finally dies down slowly, and becomes a little disturbing but not hazardous to my safety on the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050133.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>According to speedometer, my speed had risen back to 15 KpH from 6 KpH. </p>
  <p>Even though that is still slow, but it is already a major speedup to this crawling day. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050137.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A slow ride does not always equal to an easy ride. My knees felt weak and my eyes felt dry. </p>
  <p>Since my sunglasses have been blown away by the wind on the day before yesterday, I can only rely on the normal glasses, </p>
  <p>and that does not keep my eyes from the harm of blinding sunshine and the UV ray. </p>
  <p>My eyes are so dry that every time I blink it hurts. Thank god that I still have some eye drops. </p>
  <p>But when applying the eye drop, I have to put the eye drop directly against my eye balls, </p>
  <p>or the drop will be lost in the wind before it lands on my eyeball.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050147.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Up and down at the hills, I slowly approach Urumchi. Thanks for the highway, there are few vehicles going on this road. </p>
  <p>I can ride on this road peacefully.</p>
  <p>A little past 9 I am out of the mountain area, and beginning to see the shape of the city. </p>
  <p>I thought I have already arrived at Urumchi, and said to my self &quot;It's a so so place.. Not really a big city.&quot;</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050150.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But it turns out that Urumchi is still 10 kilometers away. I ride on the road alongside the riverbank. </p>
  <p>Urumchi really is not a windy place; the nightmare in the wind gap is finally over.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050151.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Riding on the road by the riverbank feels very good. Of course bicycles are forbidden on this road, but who cares. </p>
  <p>Advance! Dido! Urumchi is only minutes away!</p>
  <p>Before I arrived at Urumchi, this city was only a fantasy to me. It is so remote, and the name is so exotic.</p>
  <p> I can't even imagine how the city looks like. But after the long day's ride in the head wind, </p>
  <p>the city finally steps out of the fantasy and comes into reality. </p>
  <p>I finally arrived at the last major city in the Chinese part of my journey, and the supply station of the long trip, </p>
  <p>Urumchi!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050156.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Skyscrapers one after another, beautiful garden arts lay around the place. </p>
  <p>Wide road, lively city, designers stores scattered all around.</p>
  <p> After I been through so many deserts and wilderness coming back to such a great city, </p>
  <p>there are so many thoughts that come into my head.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even compared to Taipei or any other major city in my past journey, Urumchi stands at the same level of excellence. </p>
  <p>Am I really in Xinjiang? This is unbelievable. Even though I know this would be a big and animated city, </p>
  <p>the scale of Urumchi greatly exceeds my imagination. </p>
  <p>This place is really the pride of Xinjiang.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050159.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I asked several passersby for directions and move towards the computer city. </p>
  <p>If I can stay at a place that is closer to it, it will be easier to collect my package.</p>
  <p>Luckily, I found a guesthouse just 300 meter outside the computer city. </p>
  <p>The cheapest room is 20 a night. I will first book for two nights, and extend it if needed.</p>
  <p>Even though the price is very affordable, the standard of this guesthouse is very high.</p>
  <p> To better describe it… This is the only place I have stayed in the 50 days of my journey that comes with an elevator.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I stepped outside the guesthouse and bought a large stir-fry jelly and two oden on a stick while the staff was filling the paperwork for me.</p>
  <p>The stir-fry jelly is really delicious. I had this once when I was in Xian. </p>
  <p>It tastes like stir-fry daikon cake, a little bit soft, side with sesame sauce, garlic paste and chili sauce, DELICIOUS!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is a long term guest in the guest house who saw me eating ordinary food from a road side stall with so much emotion. </p>
  <p>&quot;This is my first meal of the day. I am starving.&quot; He nods to me showing that he understands me.</p>
  <p>He tells me about the surroundings. I am really lucky today, staying at a place with convenient transportation. </p>
  <p>This place is like a bus transit center, I can take the bus to most places. </p>
  <p>This is really an affordable and convenient guesthouse.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050164.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I filled my stomach easily. It costs a lot of money since I have been always eating BBQ recently. </p>
  <p>If I don't watch my wallet, my journey will turn into a millionaire's holiday.</p>
  <p>Although there is already a person who is staying in the room for three that I am in, </p>
  <p>he doesn't look like a bad guy and will be leaving tomorrow. </p>
  <p>Besides, I will not leave the room tonight, so my baggage will be safe in this room.</p>
  <p>This room will be totally my territory after he leaves tomorrow. Wahahahaha.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Urumchi is still a lively place in the evening. </p>
  <p>The noise of the shops and the passerby only dies down two hours after midnight.</p>
  <p>Arriving at Urumuvhi in one piece is a great encouragement to me. </p>
  <p>When I think back to the times when I was still planning my journey, I did not even have a clue on how to get to Urumchi from Beijing. </p>
  <p>And now, here I am. </p>
  <p>In this nearly-five-thousand-kilometers journey, there has been sun and rain, laughter and tears, and I have finally arrived at Urumchi safely. </p>
  <p>Although my final destination Paris is still more than ten thousand kilometers away, but in my mind, the goal is only a step ahead.</p>
