  <p class="style5">Having fun in Urumqi</p>
  <p>After receiving most of the packages from Taiwan, I was almost ready to go, </p>
  <p>except—I still needed to wait for my sun glasses, which were shipped out today.  </p>
  <p>However, DHL does not do business in Urumqi; everything has to be rerouted at Xian, troublesome and time consuming. </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the best way to avoid being blind under prolonged exposure to the sun is to wear proper sun glasses. </p>
  <p>So I could only wait, wait for another week or so, meaning “It is time to play”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I finished two packs of chocolate milk that I bought from downstairs, and was ready to go to the “International Grand Bazaar”, </p>
  <p>which is also an important attraction for pocket pickers.</p>
  <p>I was told that I should carry my bags in the “front” when I go there. </p>
  <p>So I packed light: camera—always on my hand, no more than 50 RMB, pen, notebook. </p>
  <p>Let’s go!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is about 2 km from this hotel to the “International Grand Bazaar (Bazaar means market in Uyghur)”, </p>
  <p>pretty good distance for a nice walk. So I left Dido here.</p>
  <p>Other than protecting the environment, I chose to travel by bike is to reduce expense—for both tickets and gas. </p>
  <p>The money I saved from these allows me to spend more time on the road.</p>
  <p>In addition, riding bike is slower than driving in a car.  So I get to take time to embrace the nature when I am in the wild.  </p>
  <p>While in the city area, I can take time to understand their culture and history—of course not as good as visiting the city on foot.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050193.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Compared to my clothes, which was cheap and casual, </p>
  <p>those fashionably-dressed Urumqi ladies can totally blind your eyes even just by looking at their backs.</p>
  <p>Due to their ethnicity, many girls here are so beautiful, and you are lucky if you get a chance to see their face. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050215.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because often these pretty faces were covered by veils.</p>
  <p>You’d better be careful if you want to take pictures here, some people don’t like to have their photos taken, </p>
  <p>and they will yell at you if you do. So whenever you raise your camera, </p>
  <p>you should ask for permission—by your body language if you can’t speak the language before you click.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050201.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The International Bazaar is the gathering place for goods-trading around this area. </p>
  <p>The streets are filled with stands/stores that sell wild varieties of goods, with the language that I couldn’t understand a word about.</p>
  <p>The people on the streets are from different places, they have their unique facial features, </p>
  <p>and their dresses reflect their own cultural background.</p>
  <p>Together they present an exotic atmosphere, to me. </p>
  <p>My suggestion to you for this place is, “single bills”. Most food or drink on this street costs 1 RMB or less, </p>
  <p>unless you are planning to enter the stores to buy other stuff.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050220.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>The stands on the street mostly sell cloth or clothes. </p>
  <p>Even the kids are good at promoting their stuff to potential customers and bargaining the price if the customers are interested.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050207.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> Although I didn’t understand a word they were saying, </p>
  <p>I was deeply fascinated by their tone and the body-language while doing business.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050209.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Looking at what I wore now, I almost bought some clothes for myself. </p>
  <p>Those clothes were roughly 20 RMB each, which was really cheap, but they will definitely take a lot of space in my packs, </p>
  <p>so I eventually gave up on that thought.</p>
  <p>Some sellers didn’t use any hangers to display their clothes, they just use their ARMS. </p>
  <p>Because the length of their arms is so limited, the amount of clothes they can sell at once is also limited. </p>
  <p>These sellers are a very interesting part of this street.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050221.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Moving down to the south of the street, </p>
  <p>I was so overwhelmed with all the stuff people sell, AND the people themselves, on both sides. </p>
  <p>There was a guy walking with a snake wrapped on his neck, which was a “detour” sign for me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050229.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>A guy with a big plate on his head dragged my attention immediately. </p>
  <p>I approached him and checked the stuff on the plate, hmmm, sweet fried bread.</p>
  <p>It was warm, just freshly made, with lots of sugar sprinkled on it. </p>
  <p>This bread tasted like the type of donuts that I have on the street in Taiwan, very yummy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050231.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>You don’t even have to ask the price, just give them a one-dollar bill, </p>
  <p>which is either the right amount, or sometimes you get 50 cents back.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After finishing the bread, of course I needed to look for something to drink. </p>
  <p>This stand had an interesting way to attract customers, the “fountain juice”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050218.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And this trick worked for me. Almost like being hypnotized, I paid 1 RMB for this over-diluted orange juice. </p>
  <p>Other than this “yellow” orange juice, he also sold a “white” drink which probably was some over-diluted milk drink.  </p>
  <p>Since it was really cheap, you shouldn’t expect much anyway.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>These stores covered with some red cloth only sell “cloth”, which is not my thing. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050224.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>So I continued another hundreds of meters, entered the “Erdaogiao Market”</p>
  <p> (Erdaogiao is the phonetic translation, meaning the second bridge), or they called “Erdaogiao Bazaar” here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050236.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Inside this “bazaar” are stores selling souvenirs, vegetable caterpillar</p>
  <p> (one type of Chinese herbs, Chinese called it “winter worm, summer grass”), </p>
  <p>Tienshan saussurea (Tienshan snow lotus), and some brand-named clothes.</p>
  <p> I didn’t even walk into that building because nothing interests me in that place. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050250.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Keep moving south, I finally arrived at the famous “International Grand Bazaar”, and the tall tower is its landmark.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050242.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Every store here is very tiny, and most of them sell similar stuff: necklaces, jewelries, silverwares, knives, instruments and so on. </p>
  <p>You can window-shop as much as you want, but if you are seriously interested in buying them, </p>
  <p>you’d better compare price from multiple stores and bargain for a reasonable price.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050265.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050252.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050253.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050254.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>For example I asked about the price of a pink jewelry box at a store, the lady inside the store said 85 RMB, </p>
  <p>and I gave a smile of “too expensive” and put it back.  </p>
  <p>A couple of minutes later, the guy from outside of the very same store asked if I was interested in anything and he would give me a great price to exchange for a friendship. I pointed at the same thing and he replied me in Chinese without hesitation, “120RMB. The lowest price, just for you”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was only “smile” earlier, but now I had to laugh out loud. Give me a break, please. Can’t you guys communicate first?</p>
  <p>Of course I didn’t say it, but I couldn’t stop laughing. I pointed at the lady and said “that lady is more like my FRIEND”. </p>
  <p>Then, they two started to “communicate” with their own language, and I bet I knew what they were communicating about.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the bottom of the big round tower is sculptures showing the different ethnicities around this area.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050261.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Local foods sold here are also different from what I had before, such as this “little hill” ice cream.  </p>
  <p>Instead of edible sugar cone, this ice cream is put inside this paper cone. </p>
  <p>The milk flavor ice cream is so delicious, even better than Haagen-Dazs ice cream.  </p>
  <p>However, there was a catch, a serious catch, the diarrhea. </p>
  <p>I had have food all over China for the past 50 days or so,even the noodle with flies in it can’t hurt my digestive system, </p>
  <p>and here I was, running in to the bathroom because of this ice cream. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050269.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Luckily I have the habit of carrying tissues with me whenever I am out traveling. </p>
  <p>Rushed into a restroom, paying my 30 cents RMB without any hesitation, I just really needed to go.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050277.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>This “fruit” looks very dry at the outside, and the red meat inside didn’t look yummy, either.  </p>
  <p>I wondered what this juice tastes like. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050270.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I walked around the Grant Bazaar and pretended that I couldn’t speak Chinese. </p>
  <p>I was practicing my communication skill without actually saying the language. This could be really useful skill once I left China.</p>
  <p>I had some grabbed rice for lunch in some alley. </p>
  <p>I was going to take some photos for that, but the owner of the stand seemed to get very angry when I raised my camera.  </p>
  <p>However, as soon as I ordered my lunch, he became much friendlier. </p>
  <p>The rice was light yellow-colored, al dente. Mixed with red, yellow, green veggies that made the dish so colorful, </p>
  <p>plus a big chunk of lamb, no wonder it is so delectable.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050279.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I found the only words I used to describe the food was “delicious”, or “super delicious” </p>
  <p>(Note: we translators, however, used delicious, yummy, tasty, delectable and so on ^_^), </p>
  <p>which couldn’t really let you feel about the food at all, and I am deeply sorry for this. </p>
  <p>If you guys have time, please visit any authentic Islamic restaurant to try their delights.  </p>
  <p>To me, Islamic food is so much better than our regular food.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050280.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>After lunch, I turned to the tiny “pyramid” to check what the beautiful building behind it was.  </p>
  <p>No, not a museum, it was a movie theater.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050196.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are full of milk tea shops around that theater.  What unique about these milk teas is, in addition to cow milk, </p>
  <p>you can order horse milk, camel milk, Xinjiang flavor milk tea, and Kazakh flavor milk tea.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050288.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>The customers can sit under the tree to enjoy the breeze. I ordered a milk tea, which came in a super size cup.  </p>
  <p>It was very hot, not sweet at all. Very “milky” taste, but didn’t taste like milk. </p>
  <p>With some unknown jelly-like stuff inside, and a bit salty, it was very hard to say if it is good or not.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050287.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>The other side of the theatre was stores selling CDs, DVDs, etc.  Copy right? I don’t think I should get into this topic, right?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I went back to the hotel to rest a bit, and then I was going to visit “Hong Shan Parks (Hong Shan means Red Mountain in Chinese)” later.</p>
  <p>The sun at noon was too much for me, so I didn’t go out until around 5 o’clock. </p>
  <p>Oh, I paid and asked to stay for 4 more nights.  </p>
  <p>I hoped there would be no other people to share this room with me for the rest of the time I stayed here. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was also about 2 km distance to Hong Shan parks, but headed North. </p>
  <p>Because the streets here are checkerboard-patterned, it should be very hard to get lost, as long as I knew which way I was going.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050294.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Since I needed to stay here for a few more days, I knew that I have to visit places such as Tianchi Lake, </p>
  <p>Nanshan Meadow, and I was guessing I would need to get more cash form the bank. </p>
  <p>I tried my ATM card but with no luck—no international cash advance available. </p>
  <p>The worst thing was, I couldn’t find my ATM card after I came back to the hotel later on tonight, </p>
  <p>which made my life even more &quot;interesting&quot; at this moment. I had to think how to get my replacement card later.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, forget about the lost card now. The trip to Hong Shan Parks was great. </p>
  <p>It sounds like a regular park, but it has 4-star rating in China.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050302.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>The best is, it is FREE, unless you want to go into some temples that did not many visitors will cost you 5 to 10 RMB.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050329.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>There are two entrances to Hong Shan Parks, North and South. </p>
  <p>I entered at the North Entrance, climbing up to the mountain which was two hundred meters higher than the city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050298.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050305.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>There are many fun activities to do, games such as shooting balloons, fishing games for kids, haunted house, boating and so on.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050415.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050419.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>This is Hong Shan falls, pretty small and thin.  So many kids were playing here, and I knew they also pee here, just a matter of time.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050312.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>If you are not big in games, you can enjoy the foods at least. </p>
  <p>Many people picnicked here, or even camped here. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050299.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>With just a piece of blanket on the grass, the whole family can have a great time in the park.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is a stall for peanuts cake. Two people hammered the cake so flat, and then folded it many times into a small cubic shape. </p>
  <p>So you can taste the crunchy multi-layer texture.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050320.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I couldn’t help myself but buying some to eat. It is not too sweet, and it didn’t stick to my teeth. </p>
  <p>It was very soft when eating it hot, but they told me that it would taste really crunchy if I let it sit for a while to cool down.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050324.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Couple of temples here, I didn’t get in any of them. </p>
  <p>Let me just take a photo here to proof that I was here. This kid was accidentally in my photo.  </p>
  <p>He was wearing the traditional “children pants” for Chinese, the opening at the back made it very easy t go to the bathroom, </p>
  <p>which made mom’s life much easier at the same time. Oh, I did share my peanuts cake with that kid.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050330.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Beijing will be holding the Olympics in 2008, so the Olympic spirit is the theme of the moment. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050315.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>The logos and history of every Olympic were hanging around this park, fitted with the lanterns and the green trees very well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I like to take group photos, which feels like some backstage report.</p>
  <p> Look at these girls, they are all very pretty. The background is the lanterns, again, Olympic theme.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050393.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Urumqi is only around 700 meters above sea level, so if you stand here at this Hong Shan Park, </p>
  <p>which is 200 meters higher, is enough to see the entire city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050319.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Hong Shan Parks, in Chinese means Red Mountain Parks, so “red mountain” is what you see here.  </p>
  <p>People started to build temples on this mountain to let others come up to enjoy the city from high above. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050349.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I was told that thousands of years ago people came here had to get down the horses and bow to pay their respect.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050342.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050358.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Many different kinds of locks hanging on these fences, </p>
  <p>really made me wonder they were for “live happily ever after” or “may you get what you wish for”?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050344.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Ha… here was the kid in my photo again; I took photo of him and his grandparents. </p>
  <p>I am sorry that I could not mail you this photo, but if you ever get a chance: Here is your photo.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050361.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>This is the sculpture of Zexu Lin, who was most recognized for his effort of against opium smuggling from British during Qing Dynasty. </p>
  <p>Right next to him is an anti-opium (or anti-drug) Ding (Note: Ding is ancient Chinese vessel with three legs).</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050339.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>A slogan at Hong Shan Parks is “You can’t imagie how beautiful Xiyu</p>
  <p> (Note: the Western regions of ancient China, usually the area beyond Jade Gate)</p>
  <p> is unless you have been to Xinjiang. Just like you can’t imagine how amazing Urumqi is unless you have climbed up to Hong Shan”.</p>
  <p> Therefore, it is fair to say, if Urumqi is the pride of Xinjiang, then Hong Shan Parks is the pride of Urumqi.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050387.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>The top of Hong Shan gives a bird’s eye view of the whole Urumqi city. </p>
  <p>These buildings were nicely designed and built to add the style to this city.  </p>
  <p>Everybody comes to this park will definitely climb to the top, </p>
  <p>but even with people everywhere, the maintenance is quite impressive.</p>
  <p>Like I mentioned earlier, this part is free of charge, but you don’t see any garbage anywhere. Isn’t it amazing?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050370.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>After 6 in the evening, the sprinkler system automatically started to water the grass, </p>
  <p>also partly on my leg, which gave me some coolness.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050395.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Entered from North Entrance, climbed to the top of Hong Shan, I exited this park at the South Entrance. </p>
  <p>When I saw this park with a different angle, “definitely a national tourist site”, I had to agree.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050402.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>From North Entrance to Hong Shan is mostly hilly road; from Hong Shan to South Entrance is mostly stairs. </p>
  <p>I saw many students here practicing “hopping on the stairs” with only one leg, so I was waiting to see if anybody fell. </p>
  <p>And the answer was, “None”, very disappointed, I must say.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050410.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>There is a “haunted house” at the South side; most theme parks in Taiwan also have the similar stuff. </p>
  <p>Well, it was not free, and I didn’t want to have nightmare, so… forget about it then! </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050405.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>I chose a different route walking back to the hotel after left the park. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050421.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>And I chose a road that was under heavy construction. </p>
  <p>Stores on this street didn’t have many customers, and you could see them post “Under Construction Sale” signs around the store. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050422.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Back to my hotel, I bought some Chinese style friend nuggets (still didn’t know WHAT nuggets those were), </p>
  <p>some veggie, beans, cauliflowers, golden needle mushrooms and eggplants. </p>
  <p>Bought an ice cold coke, I was having my dinner already.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050423.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>However, just when I was happily recapping today’s tour in my brain, </p>
  <p>I thought about my lost ATM card when I put my hand into my pocket.  </p>
  <p>Well, I probably won’t be able to have any coke or other drink except free water, before I solved my “financial” problem.</p>
  <p>So I sipped my coke very slowly, I knew I will miss the taste of this coke for sure.</p>
