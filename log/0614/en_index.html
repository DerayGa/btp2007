  <p class="style5">Lost and Found</p>
  <p>I was planning to go to Nanshan Farm today, but I decided to reset my priority, you know, first thing first.</p>
  <p>Even though I didn't think it was possible, I went to the bank to see if they can retrieve my credit card. </p>
  <p>I thought I really should just report a lost card.</p>
  <p>With an empty stomach, I went into the bank.  The cashier asked for my ID, I told her the only thing I had with me was my passport.  </p>
  <p>Immediately, she knew I was looking for my Taiwan credit card.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050958.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I filled a form, signed my name, I gave my credit card a big “welcome home” hug. </p>
  <p>I would really need this card later on when I entered Europe.</p>
  <p>The fee for cash advance was way too high here,  I would wait for the money that Misasa wired to me later.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mr. Bai came to look for me after I went back to the hotel. </p>
  <p>He was in charged of the sales for MSI (Micro-Star International) at Xinjiang branch.  </p>
  <p>He helped me tremendously when I was here, including receiving packages from Taiwan, sending packages to Taiwan. </p>
  <p>Even let me use his account to receive the money wired from Taiwan when he knew I lost my ATM card.</p>
  <p>Thanks for the extremely efficient Mr. Bai and Misasa, I finally have cash again. </p>
  <p>The only thing I needed to decide at this moment was if I should convert this US currency to RMB.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050963.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In the mean time, Misasa got another pair of 720 Armour T337 sun glasses from the owner, Dino, of the RST shop. </p>
  <p>She also got me a pair of regular glasses, and sent them both via DHL. </p>
  <p>Now I don't have to worry about getting sun burn of my eyes anymore.</p>
  <p>The old and new pair of sun glasses are basically the same model, only the color of the frames are different. </p>
  <p>The old pair has a black frame, and this one has a silver frame.</p>
  <p>Because of the tragic experience, I had added some elastic strap to secure my new glasses on my ears, </p>
  <p>and a neck strap to prevent the glasses run away from me again.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050964.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So far, I got a pair of replacement sunglasses, retrieved my credit card from the bank, and received the cash wired from Taiwan.</p>
  <p>One by one, many thanks to Misasa in Taiwan and Mr. Bai at Xinjiang, all my problems were solved, </p>
  <p>otherwise, I was really not sure how was I going to continue my trip like this.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But now, I am good again, I even bought some ice cream to celebrate at the hotel.</p>
  <p>I spent the afternoon to organize the stuff I wanted to mail back to Taiwan.</p>
  <p>Because the tires on Dido were still in a good condition, there was no need to retire them at Urumqi </p>
  <p>(maybe I will check again when I arrive at the Kazakjstan border?).  </p>
  <p>So I ended up with 6 spare tires: I had 2 and Misasa just sent me 4.  </p>
  <p>In order to fit them all in my packs, I decided to send stuff like China map, entrance tickets, some souvenirs, back to Taiwan. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was very hopeful that I could finally leave here to continue my ride. </p>
  <p>My original plan was to stay at Urumqi for 3 days, and now was the day 5 already. I almost felt like a residence here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050971.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I walked to the northwest side of Urumqi city and back to the hotel yesterday, and it was quite a long walk, </p>
  <p>which actually boosted my confidence about my physical condition. </p>
  <p>Today, I decided to challenge myself again, to walk to the northeast part of the city. </p>
  <p>I should see the Shuimogou Park, some nature spring, six mountains and a river. </p>
  <p>It should be a big park.  I walked for one and a half hour, passed several traditional markets.  </p>
  <p>I was always very attracted by the fruits and veggie stands, with the price of 1-2 RMB per jing (1 Jing is about 1.1 pound), </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050979.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I can save a lot of money if I cook the food myself.  </p>
  <p>BUT, it was too much trouble to do so.  </p>
  <p>I ended up buying the pancakes (the kind with multi-layers) and finishing them on the way to Shuimogou Park.</p>
  <p>It only cost 1 RMB to come here by bus.  But I felt kind of laying back after staying here for so many days.  </p>
  <p>I thought this was an excellent workout opportunity for me, and I could always take bus back if I was really tired later on.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050977.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>By 8:30, I finally saw the big sign ”Shuimogou Park”, right in front of me. </p>
  <p>My legs were so tired that I can only keep going by imagining how magnificent the nature spring and watermills would be once I found them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050983.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I walked and walked and I could not find the park. </p>
  <p>How could such a big park just disappear on earth?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050986.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Judging by these constructions, I was afraid that I got the worst timing to visit here. </p>
  <p>I walked around the construction site and tried to find any trace of the PARK.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050988.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050991.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>With so many trees here, maybe it should be renamed as some forest/woods.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050993.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Following a small path, I saw the boarder of Urumqi city, some mountains, and some huge buildings look like power plants.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1050998.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060017.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>No matter how hard I tried, all I could see were trees and mountains, no spring, no watermills.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060019.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Finally I saw a lady who was doing her walks, </p>
  <p>and she told me that I needed to continue for another 4 km to see the nature spring and watermills.</p>
  <p>Oh My God!!!  I can not walk any further, I was too tired. </p>
  <p>I was afraid if I forced myself to walk another 4 km, I would not be able to ride my bike tomorrow.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060022.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I walked back down to the entrance, and found the bus station.</p>
  <p> I took No.3 bus to get back to the hotel. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060024.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060025.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After spraying rest of the &quot;Zero&quot; (similar to Icy Hot or Bangay that can relieve muscle pain) on my legs, </p>
  <p>I threw away the empty bottle. One less burden for Dido!</p>
  <p>As for tonight, I was sure I would be so busy rearranging my packs, to get ready for tomorrow’s journey. </p>
