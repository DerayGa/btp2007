  <p class="style5">Fleck &amp; Jacquin</p>
  <p>Because the size of the regular steamed buns is kind of small for me, </p>
  <p>I usually eat them like the way I would eat “Little Basket Buns (or Soup Dumplings, a tradition Shanghai food). </p>
  <p>“Normal” people can eat 3-5 for breakfast. I, on the other hand, </p>
  <p>usually get the whole basket of the steamed buns.  </p>
  <p>It turned out that the buns at this breakfast place were bigger than I expected, </p>
  <p>I ate the whole 10 buns-with pork filling, plus one salty tofu pudding, and I was way too stuffed.</p>
  <p>“Carrying” my full stomach, I really wanted to take a nap at the hotel.  </p>
  <p>I thought maybe this could be a brunch, save some money, too.</p>
  <p>Just when I started paddling, my right foot stupidly kicked the protection plate on the bike. </p>
  <p>It was a bit loose before, and now, it was broken. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060276.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Thank god that it was not a critical part of my Dido, might as well just took it out completely, and that was what I did.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I saw less people after leaving Jinghe, but compared to Gobi Desert, it was still full of life at this area. </p>
  <p>You could even see green here and there.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060330.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was riding alongside the mountain track, on which the mountain was on my left. </p>
  <p>The snow on the top of the mountain seemed never melt. </p>
  <p>Right now, the clouds on the top brought out a really nice mountain silhouette.</p>
  <p>Whenever I felt hot, I took a glance at the mountain to cool down myself.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060298.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Two hours later, I arrived at the Toto gas station, you know, gas station is my best friend:</p>
  <p>“Cold water to wash my face, free. </p>
  <p>Nice shade to cool down, free.</p>
  <p>Great coke, 3 RMB.</p>
  <p>One hour to relax, priceless.”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060313.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I took off the shoes and socks, sat next to the gas pump to have my lunch—a can of coke and a couple of crackers</p>
  <p> (don’t forget the 10 buns from the breakfast were still somewhere in my digestive system).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, couldn’t help but falling asleep after lunch, as usual. A slow day for the gas station is a great day for me, </p>
  <p>because I don’t have to worry about being disturbed while taking my nap.</p>
  <p>Around 2 o’clock, I woke up and continued my trip. Luckily, the wind was on my side this afternoon. </p>
  <p>I was so tired of riding against the wind through most part of China.  </p>
  <p>I only hope my luck can continue even when I enter Kazakhstan later.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060309.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Where there is grass, there is animal farming. </p>
  <p>Those cute little lambs making the bah bah sounds so loud that made me feel so hungry (dripping water from mouth).</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060286.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>About one hour after I left Toto gas station, I saw two bikers on the other side of the road. </p>
  <p>We saw each other at the same time. Because this national highway was divided by barriers for the two opposite traffic, </p>
  <p>I had to lean my Dido on the barrier and climbed over to say Hi.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They definitely don’t look like Chinese, so I talked to them in English.</p>
  <p>It turned out that they are a retired couple from France. </p>
  <p>They started at Kazakhstan, and destination is Tibet, and today is their 10th day on the road.  </p>
  <p>Even they are 62 years old already; they are still very actively pursuing their dream.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060314.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Fleck can speak some English, and I can speak very limited French.  </p>
  <p>But we certainly had a good time talking to each other.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The first question they asked me was, if there was food and drink around. Well, they certainly looked beat.  </p>
  <p>I told them just to hang in there a little longer and they can find that gas station I just took a nap at.   </p>
  <p>They of course were very glad to hear the good news.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>These are their bikes. They had more luggage than I did, even they shared the load, </p>
  <p>but you can still see there are lots of weights on both of them.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060315.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>They mostly camped on the road, unless they really needed to take a shower, so they had a much tougher time that I did.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060316.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Fleck really cared about her nails.  However, this trip had already ruined her nice polished nails.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They lived at the East part of France. I told them that I toured France two years ago and I might even passed by their town. </p>
  <p>I will visit France again at the end of this BTP tour.</p>
  <p>Fleck had a special notebook, not only she kept diary of their trip there, </p>
  <p>she also kept many pictures of their grandkids in this notebook. </p>
  <p>Fleck’s face was all lit up when she showed me the photos, she even pointed at the photos,</p>
  <p> as if she can make those kids laugh just by doing this.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060321.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Like I said, they are already 62; they can easily stay in France to enjoy life. </p>
  <p>Even if they really want to visit Tibet, they can go by other means. </p>
  <p>But they just chose to bike there, a rather challenging way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Their bikes were very “cute”:  both of them had puppets on their bike handles. Jacquin has a giraffe, and Fleck has two bears.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060318.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060323.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Both of their bikes have rear mirrors as well, however, I did notice that their water bottles were empty,</p>
  <p> no wonder the first thing their asked me was about food and drink.  </p>
  <p>I offered my water, but they wanted me to keep that for myself. </p>
  <p>Jacquin wore a hat with a pair of long “ears”, which can block the sun. Ha…. Under that hat is ---his head ONLY.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060317.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Although Jacquin didn’t speak English, we still managed to have a great time through Fleck’s translation both ways. </p>
  <p>They asked how it was possible for me to keep the jacket and pants on in a hot day like this. </p>
  <p>I took a closer look at them, they wore shirts, but their sleeves were rolled up high, so the exposed area got really serious tanned.</p>
  <p> I explained that it is really important to “cover” yourself up, especially in a sunny day like today.</p>
  <p>I also showed them my well-protected arms/hands--not tanned.  I thought they finally got my point, hopefully.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060327.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was so happy to meet “my” kind of people—travel on bike.  We exchanged e-mail address, </p>
  <p>and I would send them the photos once I found the internet.</p>
  <p>Fleck gave me a big hug and a light kiss on my cheek. I was a bit embarrassed. </p>
  <p>So I hugged Jacquin and said, “Sorry to hug your wife”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>About 40 more kms later, I would arrive today’s destination—Jinghe. </p>
  <p>On the way there, all I could think of was weather they found the gas station or not. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060356.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This national highway was fenced on both sides, so it was not likely for vehicles or pedestrians to leave the road.</p>
  <p> The villages along this highway now looked even lonelier by standing out there.</p>
  <p>Restaurants or hotels, garages or stores, only the signs were still hanging there.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060303.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ah! I found the guilty one—the way they repaired the road. </p>
  <p>It seemed like they cracked the road in the middle first, and then the hot asphalt was poured directly onto it. </p>
  <p>The repair process would be completed when the asphalt was dried. Unfortunately, </p>
  <p>I came to this road while the asphalt was still wet, so my Dido took the heat by carrying this black sticky stuff on its tires.</p>
  <p>It took a whole day to cool down/dry the asphalt, so the tires finally stopped picking up rocks everywhere I went.</p>
  <p> It was really a hard work to scrap those rocks off the tires.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060336.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Before entering Jinghe, I saw a sign saying “Yurt”.</p>
  <p> I detoured to check it up, because it sounded a fun place to visit, and free, too?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060341.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060343.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Well, what I saw was a couple of colorful sticks, and little “hill” made with rocks.</p>
  <p> On the top of the “rock hill” were several tree branches with many ribbons. And this is called Yurt.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060354.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is how it got started.  It was just an empty place, like any ordinary place. </p>
  <p>Then one day, someone walked here, rested a bit, and he/she stacked one rock on top of another. </p>
  <p>Then he/she put up a tree branch, then he/she tied a ribbon on the branch, </p>
  <p>then he/she left. People passed by afterwards did the same.  Years and years later, we have this at this place.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One hour later, I finally arrived at Jinghe. </p>
  <p>I would have to climb all the way up whole day tomorrow, so I really needed to find a comfortable bed to rest well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060361.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The city was so full of live, that I almost couldn’t believe that I was in a deserted area one hour ago. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060367.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I chose a hotel that was right next to a night market, and I couldn’t wait to stuff myself.</p>
  <p> I was going to use the money I saved from this cheap hotel to award my stomach. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060386.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had a chicken casserole and a bottle of local Wusu beer for dinner. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060389.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then I felt that there was something missing, so I ordered five lamb shish kebobs. </p>
  <p>Remembered the lambs I saw today, and I told you that made me so hungry?  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060391.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Dinner time is my happiest moment of a day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This was the sky at 10:30 at night, still way too bright. </p>
  <p>I bet the moms here can never tell their kids that “Remember to come home before it gets dark”, </p>
  <p>because….. Kids will probably never come home untill mid-night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1060397.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The bright sky always confused me about the real time, or which time zone I should follow. </p>
  <p>I guess I would have to adjust myself after entering Kazakhstan then.</p>
