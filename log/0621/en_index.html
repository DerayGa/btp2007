  <p class="style5">Super shortcut!</p>
  <p>Two o’clock in the morning, the generator was out of gas, therefore, out of electricity.  </p>
  <p>In the mean time, the charcoal heater died and there were only ashes left.</p>
  <p>It was freezing, everything was cold—slippers, blankets, pillow, and me.  I can’t stop worrying if I would die in my sleep like this.</p>
  <p>Can’t take the risk!!!  I ran to get my sleeping bag out.  I’d rather look like a paramecium than freeze to death.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I didn’t open my sleepy eyes until 9:30 in the morning. To my surprise, it was so HOT outside. </p>
  <p>It was really amazing that the temperature fluctuates so dramatically between day and night at this lake area.</p>
  <p>The hostess invited me to have breakfast together when she saw me peeking from the tank. </p>
  <p>It looked like they were just about to start their breakfast, meaning I wasn’t as late as I thought.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The breakfast was still the momo (kind of Xinjiang-style nag) cut into triangle shape, dipped with homemade shortening. </p>
  <p>With some warm milk, it was almost heaven.</p>
  <p>Thank god that my digestive system was really tough to take all these dairy products this morning. </p>
  <p>Finally I petted my tummy after finishing three big bowls of milk. Well, I guessed I was full already.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After done packing, I told myself I should get going. </p>
  <p>This 90 km from Sayram Lake to Korgas city, my last stop in China, is mostly downhill. </p>
  <p>It should be nice and easy, as long as I don’t fall into any valley of some sort.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070397.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I really had such a wonderful time with Azhanma family, and I felt really sad that at the end, </p>
  <p>the best way to show my appreciation was the most direct and practical mean, cash.</p>
  <p>The grabbed rice yesterday was 10 RMB, overnight stay was 30.  </p>
  <p>The charcoal was free—I didn’t want to pay extra for the charcoal, but the kind hostess was worried about me so she threw in those for free. </p>
  <p>Dinner last night and breakfast this morning together were 10. So total was 50 RMB.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I woke up Azhanma, who was lying on the grass with a cowboy hat covering his face, </p>
  <p>and told him that I would like to pay for the horseback riding before I left. </p>
  <p>I did have a good 4-hour ride, but he insisted to charge me only for one hour, which was 30 RMB.</p>
  <p>While I was waving goodbye for the last time, the hostess slipped some momo to me for the road... T_T</p>
  <p>Thank you all so much for your hospitality. I traveled so far, but you all made me feel like I was home again.</p>
  <p>I said “Thank you” in Kazakh to them and finally moved on.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070402.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The road condition was terrible after leaving the lake area, </p>
  <p>and the steep downhill ride made it so difficult and tiresome to hold tight on the handles.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070400.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070414.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>However, the next 40 km of downhill was simply nice and smooth. </p>
  <p>The only time I needed to stop was when the herd of sheep was crossing the road.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Talk about those sheep, there must be hundreds of them. They crossed the road with their own speed, </p>
  <p>since the shepherd on the horse had no intention to rush them at all. </p>
  <p>All the cars were waiting, waiting for those sheep to pass the car, one by one. </p>
  <p>They passed my bike—they were gentle animals, they didn’t attack me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070425.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had to say, it felt very different to watch them passing when I was on Dido or on a horse.</p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dasojySjYjM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070433.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As soon as the sheep passed me, I started to move too.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070437.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>This area was called “Fruit Valley”(Guozhigo), where was famous for its honey and pollen products. </p>
  <p>The scenery was magnificent, I thought I finally knew how it felt to ride a bike in the valley.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070418.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I arrived at my first city, Lucaogou (means: reed valley), at noon. </p>
  <p>All the restaurants along the street had numbers on their sign, </p>
  <p>as if the only and/or the best way for tourists to choose their favorite place to eat was by number.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070445.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I totally lost my appetitive by this setting, so I decided to continue to Qingshuihe(means: clear and clean river) town, w</p>
  <p>hich was around 10 km away from here.</p>
  <p>Leaving the valley, I rode on a smooth and straight road, which speeded up the downhill cruising.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070467.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The corps along the roadside also changed dramatically, all you could see here were the taller-than-me corns.</p>
  <p>Well, I knew I could not tell from chicks to ducklings. I was definitely sure this must be corn field, I t-h-i-n-k.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070448.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Qingshuihe is not only the name of the town, but also a name of this river.  </p>
  <p>It is a river without much water but muddy, guess it was from the construction at the upstream area.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070452.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Crops grown at this area were not as healthy as that in other area that I visited earlier.  </p>
  <p>And I was guessing that those mud walls might attract more weeds/grass, which didn’t help out this situation at all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070454.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>With my sixth sense, I picked a rather quiet restaurant for lunch in Qingshuihe.</p>
  <p>I ordered a pork stew and rice, very Chinese style, which made me almost forget that I was at the border of China already.</p>
  <p>The food was delectable, the waiters were friendly, but to my surprise, it was NOT quiet after all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070459.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was so sure that I was the only customer when I stepped into this restaurant. </p>
  <p>The waiter was so board that the only thing he can do was to smash the flies.</p>
  <p>Then, all of a sudden, several tour buses brought in tons of people into this restaurant.</p>
  <p>After lunch, I plugged my laptop onto the power outlet near by the door, to update my blog. </p>
  <p>I worked until 2 am last night and only managed to finish the picture part, so I thought I should finish the writing part now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I didn’t want to cause a scene inside of the restaurant, so I chose to sit by the door. </p>
  <p>After those tourists finished their lunch, lots of them came out for cigarettes, and of course they saw me and my Dido.</p>
  <p>THEN, I was surrounded by the FAQs and cameras.</p>
  <p>I thought it couldn’t get worst than this, so I closed the laptop and chatted with them carelessly, </p>
  <p>and hope they would loss interest in me in no time.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070464.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Nope! One by one, those tourists all came out to corner me with their questions, cameras.  </p>
  <p>Some even asked for my autographs, or had photos with me.</p>
  <p>I showed my silly smile in the photos, I signed my autographs with “BTP” and its link. </p>
  <p>Maybe it will be their turn to be surprised later when they find out I was from Taiwan.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070465.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I arrived at the restaurant at 1:30, and planned to finish updating my blog here. </p>
  <p>But the tourists from different tour buses came in all the time which made it almost impossible. </p>
  <p>Thanks to the owner’s wife gave me a private room to concentrate my work.  </p>
  <p>By the time I finally finished update, those restaurant staff were finally having their lunch, too.  </p>
  <p>So I shared with them my blog, and obviously they enjoyed reading them too.</p>
  <p>I left at about 5:30, and thought the 30 km to Korgas should be a piece of cake.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A few km later, I saw a border patrol booth. They usually check your ID and let go, </p>
  <p>but I didn’t have “their” ID, and I didn’t want to get shot from the back.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070469.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So, I walked over to ask the soldier, who didn’t even notice I was walking over, if they wanted to check my documents.</p>
  <p>He looked at me for a while and said, “OK… Show me your document then”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ha! I carried these so important and yet so forgettable documents-- my passport and Taiwan-ID-for-entering-China for two months, </p>
  <p>and I finally can show them, officially, to some “official people”.</p>
  <p>The funny thing was, as soon as that soldier saw my passport; he called his friend over,</p>
  <p>“Hey, come quick. Have you ever seen a Taiwan passport?”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070476.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Unbelievably, those two flipped through my passport, </p>
  <p>checked the visas from Kazakhstan, Russia, Poland, and EU, and asked where I was going exactly.</p>
  <p>Because I am not from China, they had to write down my information on a book for record. </p>
  <p>I finally got my documents back and headed to Korgas.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070478.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Entering Kazakhstan actually ended the downhill ride. I started to climb up under the hot sun.  </p>
  <p>It was so hot that I felt that some one was branding my exposed legs.</p>
  <p>During the rest of the ride, I stopped wherever I saw a gas station for a popsicle and a drink, to cool down my body.</p>
  <p>I tried to ask around the situation at Kazakhstan, and I met a truck driver who said he saw many backpack bikers like me. </p>
  <p>Most scary part was he said that he met and shook hands with a “famous” backpack traveler who died in the desert a couple of days later.</p>
  <p>I gasped, “Please don’t be too friendly, dude!  No hand-shaking is necessary. Head-nodding is more than enough between us.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That truck driver advised me not to spend the night at Korgas unless it was necessary, </p>
  <p>because everything there was expensive and the security was a big concern too.</p>
  <p>So he suggested staying at a small town, 62 Tuan (a military group) before Korgas instead. </p>
  <p>There is a military group (62 Bingtuan) stationed there, and everything is much cheaper. </p>
  <p>So now I had a backup plan if Korgas was as bad as that truck driver described.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Half hour later, I arrived at Korgas, the border town of China and Kazakhstan!  </p>
  <p>I had pictured it in so many different ways in my brain, and the reality didn’t match any of my imaginations, not even close.</p>
  <p>1.	It is not exactly a well-developed city.  Many constructions were still going on everywhere you go.</p>
  <p>2.	There are different ethnic groups of people making their trade here, but definitely not as many as I thought it would be.</p>
  <p>3.	This is such a small city! The main street—OuYa Road, runs through the entire city, </p>
  <p>plus two other major roads that cross OuYa Road, are all I can introduce about this city’s “highway” system.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070483.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Two buildings that I would like talk about here.  One is the Korgas Port World Trading Center.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070499.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> Building of China Customs.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070502.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If you go straight here, you will enter the Customs. </p>
  <p>Although it was close at this moment and won’t be open again until 10 o’clock tomorrow morning, </p>
  <p>many trucks already lined up here the night before. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070493.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had to use my hand to block the sun, in order to take pictures against the light.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070495.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Well, it seemed to be well-accepted to occupy the streets by these trucks like this, </p>
  <p>and the drivers were making conversations to kill time. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070498.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As to me, now I had some idea about the customs/border situation here,</p>
  <p> I could start looking for the place to spend the night.</p>
  <p>I had asked 5 or 6 hotels and I really hated their price here. </p>
  <p>The cheapest one was 60 RMB, not to mention the quality of the room was just terrible.</p>
  <p>A guy selling the scallion pancake said it is true that everything is expensive here, </p>
  <p>he also suggested me to go back to the previous town, 62 Tuan</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070508.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>He even told me a shortcut to ride back there.  I followed his direction, and ended up at the dead end. </p>
  <p>Just when I was wondering what was going on and decided to turn back, I saw another biker.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070513.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I asked him for direction, he said I could follow him because he was also heading to that town.  </p>
  <p>Before I knew it, he had already turned into a narrow path.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070514.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>At the beginning, I thought it was a small country road, but it just got worse.</p>
  <p>We passed through a cornfield, passed through cows that were munching the grass.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070517.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just when I felt the road condition was getting ridiculously terrible, </p>
  <p>I was told to “carry” Dido crossing the can’t-be-narrower stone bridge on the river, </p>
  <p>and we went through another similar bridge,</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070521.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070522.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> I had to say:” This is really some shortcut, a super shortcut!”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I still had to thank him to lead me through the “shortcut” to 62 Tuan, though.</p>
  <p>The first impression I got was the beautiful willow trees on both sides of the street. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070524.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This was also a crowded town.  You can find almost every type of shops/stores, including internet café.</p>
  <p>I found a cheap B&amp;B nearby this “Ray of Hope” sculpture, only cost me 20 RMB a night, luxury room, too. </p>
  <p>This is so much better than those ones at Korgas.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070525.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070526.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I made a bargain of 50 RMB for 3 nights. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070530.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I would look for Kazakhstan map at some local bookstores, exchange currency at the bank, </p>
  <p>and try my best to recover myself so I can be ready to start the next stage of journey soon.</p>
  <p>It has been two months since I started the BTP tour.  Standing at the boarder of China-Kazakhstan, </p>
  <p>I know we all are excited to see how the new chapter begins.</p>
