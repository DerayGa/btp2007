  <p class="style5">Border Town Temperature</p>
  <p>Waking up with a strange feeling in 62 Tuan, it was not a cold or a headache, but a toothache.</p>
  <p>To make it accurate, I had two lumps on the inner lower gum in the right side of my mouth, no tooth pain but mouth pain and lump pain.</p>
  <p>In order to avoid the lumps, I could not bite down, which told me a cruel fact that I won’t be able to eat.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Stopping by 62 Tuan was simply for rest and recovery. </p>
  <p>Nothing particular was planed but finding some time to go to Huoerguosi for maps and money exchange.</p>
  <p>I stayed in an Internet café when the sun was intense in the morning. </p>
  <p>I felt hungry but could not eat so I bought a bread-like sweet sesame twist and swallowed it with juice.</p>
  <p>I thought it would be ok if it was not a toothache and the swelling should go down soon. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fleck and Jacquin sent me an email today. I was so glad to hear from them. </p>
  <p>After we hugged goodbye, they were heading for the gas station that I told them where was about 20 km away.</p>
  <p>They camped on the floor in the gas station at night, eating gas station food and drinking two liters of Pepsi. </p>
  <p>They are cute dad and mom. I won’t call them elders even they are in their sixties, because they still have young passion and energy.</p>
  <p>Wishing them good luck and arriving Tibet safely. It is never too late to start an adventure as long as we have dreams.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, my mouth swelling was getting worse. </p>
  <p>I could not talk properly so nobody seemed to understand what I was saying.</p>
  <p>I wanted to see a doctor, but there was no hospital in 62 Tuan. </p>
  <p>The hotel lady suggested buying medicine from the pharmacy next door.</p>
  <p>Being not able to speak clearly,I mumbled what medicine to buy for toothache.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070538.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Without any checkup, I was given three different drugs to choose from, </p>
  <p>painkiller, antibiotic and something that even the pharmacist did not know.</p>
  <p>Pondering real quick, I picked out the antibiotic. Out of expectation, it was cheap – 3 RMB only.</p>
  <p>Hopefully, it really worked on me and reduced swelling. Please, don’t let me get the counterfeit drugs…</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Staying in an internet café for the whole day would be too depraved. </p>
  <p>I got to run a few errands first and then checked out the town. Meanwhile, the sun was way too intense and scorching hot. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070540.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070543.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Wandering around the market in the hot sun was like melting chocolate. </p>
  <p>I had not eaten any real meal yet, but under current condition what I could eat.</p>
  <p>I bought two large sponge cakes at the bakery stall and perhaps did not have to chew at them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070546.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Many stalls by the roadside were selling shaved ice. </p>
  <p>Not having shaved ice for quite some time, I really needed my shaved ice fix on such a hot day.</p>
  <p>The shaved ice with pineapple was made in the opposite way than Taiwan where it started with ice then topped with ingredients.</p>
  <p>Here, it was made with the ingredients at the bottom of very coarsely shaved ice.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070549.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I carefully tried a bite, which did not hurt my lumps. Then I happily started eating. </p>
  <p>In the meantime, my watch thermometer showed the temperature was going up to 40 degrees Celsius. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After the shaved ice I walked back to the hotel in the stinking hot sun. </p>
  <p>If it was so hot here, was the same heat waiting for me in Kazakhstan as well?</p>
  <p>I’d better well plan the routes and water supply for the coming trip. It was no good to get dehydrated.</p>
  <p>Back to the hotel, I washed the dirty clothes being worn for three days and then took a nap.</p>
  <p> I would be heading for Huoerguosi when the sun was getting less intense.</p>
  <p>Still hot at 8:00 in the afternoon, would it cool down after the sun came down?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Putting on my coat and hat, I was off in the late afternoon sun again. </p>
  <p>It was about time for sunset but the sun was still fierce.</p>
  <p>I went to Huoerguosi by public bus, 1 RMB for one way – very convenient, and no way to ride in such hot weather.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070557.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When arriving in Huoerguosi, I would be asking people where to buy maps.</p>
  <p>I got off at the Huoerguosi main bus terminal where the largest bookstore of Huoerguosi was nearby. </p>
  <p>The largest bookstore looked like a small countryside bookstore and did not carry maps.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070559.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Strangely, selling maps of adjacent countries seemed to be a sure thing in border towns. </p>
  <p>How come it was so difficult to find maps here?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070567.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Many shops along the street that I passed by yesterday were selling products from Kazakhstan and Russia, </p>
  <p>but no bookstore, so I walked across a park toward the border.</p>
  <p>There was a trade center selling imported goods such as French perfume, Russian porcelain dolls, </p>
  <p>chocolate, knives, binoculars, mirrors, shawls, carpets, and much other stuff. </p>
  <p>It was just like a mall with many shops selling similar goods just like the Dabazha in Urumqi.  </p>
  <p>Their initial asking prices were all bluffed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070571.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070575.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070581.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As I walked into the trade center, the salesmen started bawling </p>
  <p>“come here, we have everything you want, come and take a look”</p>
  <p>Bawling and yelling comes and goes, I looked around, finding a friendly looking guy and asking </p>
  <p>“I am looking for Kazakhstan map, do you have it?” </p>
  <p>He did! I had searched the entire 62 Tuan and Huoerguosi and could not find the map, </p>
  <p>but found it in this trade center where I usually would never bother to come.</p>
  <p>However, it was not the easy-to-carry type atlas with detail routes but a large piece of paper.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070572.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In addition, the map was labeled with Chinese and literally useless since the road signs in Kazakhstan could not be in Chinese.</p>
  <p>Under current situation – no map at all, I took it and hold on to it. Perhaps I could find a detailed map in Kazakhstan.</p>
  <p>“How much?”</p>
  <p>The asking price was 25 RMB. Waving my hand saying no, I was ready to leave. </p>
  <p>As expected, I was stopped. This time I was not given a discounted price but a question:</p>
  <p>“Don’t go, how much you would pay for it, say your number”</p>
  <p>Wasn’t it nonsense? There was no tag price or reasonable price. </p>
  <p>It was for sure if people paid the asking price, they were fools.</p>
  <p>No matter how good your bargain skill was, </p>
  <p>when you thought you got a good deal you were actually still a lamb because the real cost was far below than what you paid.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>How much I would like to pay? Beats me! How much was reasonable for a map with a 25 RMB asking price.</p>
  <p>My bargain 101 – half price for all asking price and rounding down the changes. I gestured ten RMB and it was SOLD.</p>
  <p>I regretted it at the moment of handing over the money, what if I offered 5 RMB, would it make a difference?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My mouth still ached and did not get better after taking the antibiotics.</p>
  <p> I was hungry and needed to eat, having liangpi outside of the trade center.</p>
  <p>[Note: liangpi is cold noodles made from either rice flour or wheat flour]</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070595.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Cold noodles were good for hot weather. It was painful not to be able to chew on sides of my mouth,</p>
  <p> and swallowing down the whole piece of liangpi was probably not good for digestion.</p>
  <p>I used my tongue and front teeth to cut and “chew’ the liangpi in small pieces then swallow them down. </p>
  <p>Even thought the food was very delicious, I could not enjoy it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I went back to 62 Tuan by bus in the intense sun. It had been so hot for the whole day from dawn to dusk. </p>
  <p>Not satisfied with the map, but I got something at least.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070558.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I chatted with people at the door of the hotel. Everybody gave me advice and the concept of Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>They all said Kazakhstan was chaotic and being watchful when traveling alone.</p>
  <p>I talked for about an hour, looking at the map and planning the next route. My final conclusion was</p>
  <p>“Be Unafraid, Be Aware”</p>
