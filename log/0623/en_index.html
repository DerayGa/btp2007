  <p class="style5">Growing Up with a Young Heart</p>
  <p>Two months after leaving Beijing I arrive at the border of China and Kazakhstan.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Mr. Ronhua Hu's advice, I didn't make my schedule too tight, </p>
  <p>so I had time to enjoy the sights and scenery on the way,and this also helped me get the rest I really needed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Arriving at the border ends the China part of my journey.</p>
  <p>The odometer shows that I've gone 5704.57 km, that's 300 km more then I had expected. </p>
  <p>But after adding the distance that I wandered out of the way and strolled out of way and the waging around on the way, I guess that's about right.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding 5000 Kilometers in two months broke my previous personal time and distance record I made when I went around France,</p>
  <p>but this will be nothing compared to the challenge waiting ahead for me.</p>
  <p>Mr. Hu was right, I had everything going for me in China.</p>
  <p>I spoke the language, the weather was great and the roads were in fairly good condition.</p>
  <p>But after I leave China, I believe nothing will be the same. </p>
  <p>I will be able to speak, but no one will understand. </p>
  <p>There will be signs, but none that I can read. </p>
  <p>Everything from the local laws to daily concern about the weather conditions will be quite unpredictable from now on.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I started in Beijing, everyone told me that the first step is the hardest..</p>
  <p>Beijing to Xi'an was kind of like a warm up, getting me ready for the challenge the vast inland had to offer.</p>
  <p>After arriving at Lanzhou the great Gobi Desert.awaited me; </p>
  <p>From there on, the ride only got harder,</p>
  <p>But soon Urumchi was in sight,and now I'm standing on the border of China and Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Every second of this journey has flashed before my eyes as if it has just happened.</p>
  <p>As if just a minute ago I was getting in a cab at Beijing airport heading toward an unknown hotel, and beginning this adventure. </p>
  <p>But now, standing here, I'm already 5000 km away.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Through this time, I've been learning to grow up and trying to think of the world in a different prospect or perhaps with a different logic. </p>
  <p>For that I have to give thanks to everything I have experienced, </p>
  <p>whether it's a simple smile or the changing of the clouds or the delicious food I have had or the endless road stretching in front of me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before and during this journey, I've got so much gratuitous support from so many people, including the money I've spend, </p>
  <p>the computer I'm using, the clothes I'm wearing, and Dido which has faithfully accompanied me throughout the trip.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In order to show my gratitude, at first I rode everyday hoping that something interesting would happen, so that I would have things to share. </p>
  <p>I even thought that if nothing happened, I just might have to run in to a wall or something so that I'd have something to write about.</p>
  <p>But soon I found out that wasn't going to be necessary. </p>
  <p>Even on the most prosaic day, there has always been something for me to feel grateful about. </p>
  <p>It could have been someone whom I'd never met before rooting me on,</p>
  <p>or a gentle breeze under the scorching sun, or a cool drink easing my thirst.</p>
  <p>So many overwhelming feelings that can't be described in words, </p>
  <p>have settled in my mind  as a simple but lasting sense of gratitude that I shall treasure forever.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Taking pictures was never my thing, but I tried at first to take pictures from my own viewpoint.</p>
  <p>By keeping a record of what I have seen and heard, </p>
  <p>I hope that those who read my travel notes can feel as if they were right here with me. </p>
  <p>But I'm sorry if the pictures latter on may have ruined your imagination</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I have heard a lot of people say that I'm like a child that will never grow up, sometimes even naive or gauche, </p>
  <p>and told me that this might hurt me in some way.</p>
  <p>Well, on this journey I have been learning to grow up by testing my limits. </p>
  <p>I have became more determined then ever while doing the things I believe are right. </p>
  <p>That might not seem to make much of a difference from whom I was before, </p>
  <p>but deep down inside, I know I am changed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I will always remember what Mr. Hu said to me just before I left Taiwan: </p>
  <p>&quot;your resources, adaptability and judgment will only come after you hit the road; there's no way I can teach you that.&quot;</p>
  <p><br />
    Whatever has changed me has happened bit by bit. </p>
  <p>Like my tanned fingers, day by day you only see a little difference, </p>
  <p>or like the 3mm of GPS readings I get everyday, and wondering when it will ever get to Paris.</p>
  <p>But now my hands look like the face of a joker, and the 3mm lines have cut through China.</p>
  <p>I look in the mirror and see the changes on the outside: like my hair grew, and then was cut in Dawanching, </p>
  <p>but what doesn't show in the mirror is what has changed inside me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had never though that these travel notes I wrote on the bedside before falling asleep would have had such a great echo of response.</p>
  <p>Whenever I hear that someone, after reading my notes,has got on a bike that they haven't ridden for decades,</p>
  <p>I truly thank these people for not just turning off their computers after a few laughs,</p>
  <p>and for taking a role in Bike To Protect Our Planet..</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are those who say that I'm just using global warming as a slogan for riding, </p>
  <p>especially because I don't really talk about it a lot in my notes.</p>
  <p>But frankly speaking, does it really make any difference in global warming </p>
  <p>if I ride from Beijing to Paris, or perhaps around the world?</p>
  <p>The answer is NO!</p>
  <p>There's no use just having a slogan; it's the actions that count.</p>
  <p>Thanks for all those who support Bike To Protect Our Planet..</p>
  <p>Because of you, we can really make a difference.</p>
  <p>The problems of global warming are what we all should care about, </p>
  <p>because we all live on the same planet, and can rely only on one another.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There's No Hero Here ( that's what I named my first travel notes),and I'll say that again when I arrive in Paris.</p>
  <p>For all those who are willing to practice and promote this idea, </p>
  <p>you are the heroes,because it is you who are the ones protecting our planet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ridding a bike is only one thing, but saving energy is what really matters.</p>
  <p>Daily stuff, like recycling, turning lights off before leaving a room, </p>
  <p>using mass transportation and cutting down on the use of air conditioning.</p>
  <p>This we all know, but whether we do it or not is another question.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I trust you all will do so, right?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are still four more months of traveling in front of me. </p>
  <p>Although I don't know what will happen tomorrow,</p>
  <p>I'm sure I'll enjoy every bit of it.</p>
  <p><br />
    I'll keep on sharing my notes and pictures whenever I can.</p>
  <p>Thanks for all of your encouragement.</p>
  <p>This cheers me on, and I know that I'm never alone.</p>
  <p><br />
    I shall arrive in Paris, no matter how long it takes. I'll be there.</p>
  <p>Under the Eiffel Tower, I shall wave the flag of BTP and the flag of Taiwan.</p>
  <p>That will be the moment I'll like to share in tears or laughter with all of you.</p>
  <p><br />
    You do believe I'll get there, don't you?</p>
