  <p class="style5">Pack up and ready to take off </p>
  <p>The owner of the hotel said that the custom will not open on Sunday. </p>
  <p>However, I still went to Huoerguosi again to validate that information. </p>
  <p>Several drivers and the bus conductor at the international bus stop all assured me that the gate will not open on Sunday.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070605.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This gives me one more day to breathe at the border. Since the bank is also closed on Sunday, I will also have to wait till Monday to change my currency. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This gave me the chance to enjoy the Sunday just like every other Sunday I spent back in Taiwan. </p>
  <p>I unpack and check my five bags, then pack it again to make some more room without losing any of my belongings. </p>
  <p>In an attempt to make it as clean as possible, I washed my clothes that I have been wearing for two month, </p>
  <p>twice Since the price for supply will soon rise after I cross the border, I try to buy as much food as I can bring with me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070628.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After I took the cheap medicine from local and the other medicine from Taiwan, my toothache is not much a problem anymore. </p>
  <p>Finally I got the chance to have some proper food. The owner of the hotel took me to his friend's restaurant for some good food. </p>
  <p>It will be much more difficult to have this delicious stuff after I leave China. </p>
  <p>Even if I have the chance to grab one of these, the price will never be this affordable again. </p>
  <p>With all these new friends, the lunch time passed happily. </p>
  <p>I ordered Kung Pao Chicken nugget, deep-fried Pork intestine, fried rice and green bean rice porridge. </p>
  <p>With so many delicious dishes, it feels like I am having my last supper. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070614.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070616.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The sixty-two division is not a big place. Almost everyone who lives within 300 meters from the hotel knows that a guy biked here, </p>
  <p>and is going to bike out of the country soon. Therefore they tend to come over and chat with me. </p>
  <p>Sitting on a bench by the hotel door, all of them told me to take good care of myself. </p>
  <p>The sincere greetings from the warm folks filled my heart and my near-exploding bag again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I washed Dido outside the hotel door, check for all nuts and strings on it and pumped the tire.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070626.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Adjust the clock of all my gadgets and add two more hours. </p>
  <p>The border gate will open tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock Kazakhstan time and 10 o'clock Taiwan time. </p>
  <p>I will be be in the line around 7 o'clock, hopefully I can make it through without much difficulties. </p>
  <p>Even though I have already traveled alone for two whole months, </p>
  <p>I still feel nervous with the thought of leaving China and entering a totally foreign country. </p>
  <p>When I think of the road ahead me, my heartbeat races and my breath shortens. </p>
  <p>The combination of nervousness and excitement runs through my head, </p>
  <p>I once again feel the uncertainty that i felt on the first day on the plane to Beijing.</p>
