  <p class="style5">Across the border</p>
  <p>I can't believe that this one month bike trip in Kazakhstan got me sleepless. </p>
  <p>I rolled on the bed and finally fall at sleep when the sun is about to rise.</p>
  <p>It feels like at the moment I fall at sleep, the alarm of my watch starts beeping. </p>
  <p>I totally want to stay in bed for some more time, but it will not be possible today.</p>
  <p>After using the bathroom, I take my bags and Dido downstairs. Since I have all my bags packed before I sleep, this doesn't take much time. </p>
  <p>I took off with the greeting from the owner of the hotel, under the morning sunshine at half pass six. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070630.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In half an hour I rode 7 kilometers on Dido, and arrived at Huoerguosi. </p>
  <p>As usual, all the trucks are still waiting in the long line at the &quot;national gate&quot;, </p>
  <p>which is the nickname of the border gate from the locals. However, unlike my previous visits,the border gate will open today. </p>
  <p>Therefore the gate is crowded with people. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070633.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>All kind of people surrounds me right after I stopped with Dido. </p>
  <p>That includes currency exchange guy, begging old lady, chatter box and the bell boys. </p>
  <p>Currency exchange is indeed an important thing to do now. I changed all the RMB into Tenge, the currency in Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>Since the currency exchange rate between RMB and Tenge is 100 to 1500, the 800 RMB in my wallet suddenly become 12000 Tenge. </p>
  <p>However, these money is no where near enough in Kazakhstan. 800 RMB can keep me biking in China for more than half a month, </p>
  <p>but I don't know if these Tenge can keep me living in Kazakhstan for three days? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070636.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I have only 7 dollar of RMB left with me after the currency exchange. </p>
  <p>One dollar for the begging old lady, and the rest of it become my breakfast at the breakfast stand.</p>
  <p>4 dollar for juice flavored milk and 2 dollars for the fruit stand. </p>
  <p>The owner of the fruit stand originally says that 2 dollars is only good for one banana, but gave in after some &quot;discussion&quot;.</p>
  <p> I left the stall with two big bananas in hand. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070645.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>With the fruit and the milk, my breakfast looks good to me. </p>
  <p>I spend all my RMBs on my breakfast, disregarding if I will need any RMB or not when I pass through the custom. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070644.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just when I was about to start my breakfast, another begging old lady comes by and asked for money. </p>
  <p>I said that I have no RMB left now; the banana is my best offer. </p>
  <p>Out of my imagination, she really took one banana with her.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It kills me that part of my breakfast just ran away. I sped up consuming my banana, or I might end up with nothing to eat. </p>
  <p>After I drank all the juice, another begging old lady came by.</p>
  <p>I really have no money with now.. don't ask for money anymore.. </p>
  <p>Now I don't event have banana for you, if you really want it, take my pity empty juice bottle.</p>
  <p>The lady really took the bottle. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At this rate, if I kept staying here, everything on me might be taken away by the army of beggars. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The custom is divided into two parts, one for the vehicles and one for the tourists.</p>
  <p>There are a lot of international buses passing this border. </p>
  <p>But to do that, all of the passengers and all the baggage need to get off the bus and pass through security check. </p>
  <p>Then get back on the bus again. This is a gigantic job. </p>
  <p>The number of baggage and passenger is so high that the scene is almost identical to refugees seeking for shelter. </p>
  <p>This makes a good business for all the bell boys. </p>
  <p>Without the trailer and the bossing yelling of the bellboys, these baggage can't even make it to the border. </p>
  <p>The considerate bell boys even wrap your baggage with tapes. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070650.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The long line at the tourist pass way consists of people from every nationalities and races and creates a magnificent view. </p>
  <p>I was planning to get in line to pass the border earlier, but the owner of the juice milk stand informs me that getting in line means nothing. </p>
  <p>The chaos will begin at the second the gate opens. People will start cut in the line, push their way, </p>
  <p>jump across the fence, throw their baggage and do what ever they can to get to the border sooner. </p>
  <p>He said that the best way to do it is sit here and rest, standing in the line will do you no good but getting you tired. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I took his word and lean by Dido at the fence of the shopping area. </p>
  <p>The custom staffs arrived in the car at half pass seven, and the border gate delays its open time for half an hour, opens at half pass eight. </p>
  <p>The good thing is that the weather is not too hot. Compared to the previous days, today is much cooler. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070649.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Birds of a feather flock together. Travelers who shares similar characteristics tend to chat a little when they are waiting at the fence. </p>
  <p>This is where I met Jens, a backpacker with a big backpack from Denmark. </p>
  <p>He has been touring for four months, starting from Europe, passing Russia, Inner Mongolia, China and Tibet, now on his way to Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>Unlike most of the backpackers who travels for fun, </p>
  <p>Jens tries to extend his professional as herbal pharmacist and studies the plants and herbs all along the way. </p>
  <p>Despite the fact that he is a teacher in Denmark and looks a few years elder than me, he is only 24 now! </p>
  <p>Do Europeans mature earlier? </p>
  <p>Actually, Jens is only trying his luck today. The valid date of his visa starts tomorrow, </p>
  <p>but he want to try his luck and see if the customs let him in one day early or not. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070652.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The gate opens promptly at eight thirty. Just like the owner of the fruit stand says, a chaos is the only word to describe the scene. </p>
  <p>Those who stays near the fence throws the baggage into the line and jump across the fence, successfully cut in to the front of the line. </p>
  <p>The bell boys piled the baggage on their trailer, yelling and pushes their way into the line with his customers follows him. </p>
  <p>You can hear all different languages saying &quot;stop pushing&quot; or swearing in their own way. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070654.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Quite a magnificent view. This is how we cross the border.</p>
  <p>Jens laughs and say that this is nothing. The border of the Russia is full of shit, </p>
  <p>the border to China from the Inner Mongolia you see everyone fighting with each other </p>
  <p>and all the jeeps that supposed to carry the passengers ran into each other. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I walked Dido through the small gate after the swarm of people became slimmer. This is still my first step through the border.</p>
  <p>Soon I got into the immigration hall, which sorts the passengers into Chinese and foreigners. </p>
  <p>This is the second time for all the passengers to line up, almost all of the people who preformed the crazy refuge act are at the Chinese side.</p>
  <p>The foreigner side is so empty that it looks likes the path for the privileged people. </p>
  <p>The custom staff saw me and Dido and tells us to pass first. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070658.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>No baggage check, no anything. They admit me across the border before checking my ID. </p>
  <p>Now that I have a stamp says &quot; Departure at Huoerguosi, 2007,06,25&quot; on my Taiwan Compatriot Pass</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By the way, although the written rules in the customs all across the globe may reads different, but most of they forbids taking photo in the custom area. </p>
  <p>If you were found taking photo at Russia custom, you might go into jail. </p>
  <p>So try not to take this bad example into account and take photo of custom along the way. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After the border, another line starts. To get into Kazakhstan we need to cross the 500 meter wide border. </p>
  <p>Walking and biking is forbidden on this part of road, and the only way to cross it is taking the shuttle bus.</p>
  <p>This 500 meter costs 20 RMBs, and on top of that the government of Kazakhstan wants a passing fee for 300 Tengo as a tip. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070662.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The buses depart one by one. Since getting Dido onto the bus is not an easy job, I tried to get on the bus without success for many times. </p>
  <p>Finally Jens managed to help me to get in a small bus when he passes through the border. </p>
  <p>Hidden inside the huge pile of baggage, I felt totally chaos and extremely happy. </p>
  <p>The others cheers for me when they saw me finally got in the bus. </p>
  <p>Since I got no more RMB with me, Jens pays the fee for shuttle bus. </p>
  <p>In return I paid the border fee for Jens with Tenge and call it even. </p>
  <p>It costs 20 RMB for merely 500 meters. Some sophisticated travelers says </p>
  <p>&quot;Dame! This is as expensive as the cab in Hong Kong!&quot; </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070666.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After the short ride on the bus, it's time to get off. People start passing the pile of baggage down the bus. </p>
  <p>Dido and I can only wait on the bus before they finish. </p>
  <p>I am kind of worried if Dido is fine sitting in the pile. </p>
  <p>A quick check up after I got off reveals that nothing is wrong besides a slightly bent fixture frame of the mud flap. </p>
  <p>I simply bent it back to fix the problem. </p>
  <p>Now that I am already departed from China, but still not yet arrived in Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>Time to get in yet another line with Dido, waiting for the paper work and immigration check up. </p>
  <p>The embarkation form is in Kazakh. The English translation in some of the fields is missing, and I don't have any clue on how to fill it. </p>
  <p>Glad that some custom officers help me out on that. </p>
  <p>Baggage check comes after the passport check. </p>
  <p>One by one, the baggage are loaded onto the X-ray machine, and people waited in line for body check. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070669.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A kid in the line smirks and asks me </p>
  <p>&quot;How the hell are you going to put your bike and the bags into that X-ray machine?&quot; </p>
  <p>I look at him, forced a smile and told him </p>
  <p>&quot;Good question. I just thought of exactly the same question.&quot; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The question became clear when it was my turn to load the baggage. </p>
  <p>The security check staff waved and tell me to come over, asked me for my passport. He scribbled something on the form.</p>
  <p>Then?</p>
  <p>I am all clear to go! </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>No baggage checkup, no body check. In both custom of China or Kazakhstan, everyone treats me and Dido nice and easy.</p>
  <p>Step out of the custom building, finally I am on the land of Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>This is also the footnote of the first adventure of border crossing in my life.</p>
  <p>Other travelers are now waiting outside the custom building, until their bus cleared custom checkup.</p>
  <p>I walk Dido to the road, and then kick my pedal to hit the road to Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>I took this photo before I left the border. </p>
  <p>Next time, the border crossing will be at the border that is full of shit – border to Russia as described by Jens. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070676.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I originally assumed that the border town will be pretty crowded on the both side of border, </p>
  <p>since there is Huoerguosi at the China side of the border. Now how about the Kazakhstan side? </p>
  <p>Not even a ghost. The only living creature I see besides human is the crows. Their noisy sounds only implies bad luck. </p>
  <p>Besides the hundred meter long lines of trucks awaiting to cross the border, </p>
  <p>no village, no shops, no restaurants, no hotels. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070688.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Another significant difference that I noticed after I crossed the border is the landscape.</p>
  <p> It's just a few kilometers away, how could the landscape changed so much? </p>
  <p>Nothing seems humanly in where I can see. Unlike the deadly silence in Gobi Desert, the land of Kazakhstan is green and lively. </p>
  <p>However, it is also extremely desolated. </p>
  <p>It seems like the population of Kazakhstan is too little and the land is too large. </p>
  <p>With no manpower to develop the land, the wild grassland is everywhere. </p>
  <p>The animal industry is also much smaller here. I can barely see any cattle around.</p>
  <p> It is an interesting contrast from what I saw back in China. </p>
  <p>There are so many Kazak cowboys in China and so few of them in Kazakhstan. How amazing. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070693.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Compared to it back in China, the gas stations here suddenly become smaller. </p>
  <p>As my best shelter in the tour, I will still rely on these gas stations all along the way. </p>
  <p>It's okay to become smaller, as long as I can still hide in its shade. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070697.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The condition of the road is not at all good. </p>
  <p>One major reason why I do not need to replace the tire of Dido </p>
  <p>after we been through the whole china is that most roads in china are finely built.</p>
  <p>But in Kazakhstan, the road is build with stones and tar, which is rough and bumpy, and is very difficult to ride on. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070785.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is the first road sign I saw in Kazakhstan. I am a bit freaked out that the sign comes with only Kazakh. </p>
  <p>Some of them still come with Russian, but English never makes its way onto these signs. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070691.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After quite some time, I finally saw the first village from the border. PENZHIM is the name. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070694.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The exterior of the house here is different from what I see back in China. </p>
  <p>Slanting roof, large yard, gives you a open feeling. A large portion of the house are made of wood. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070707.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Another major difference is the warm welcome from the people. Kazakhs are totally friendly, inviting and passionate.</p>
  <p>The percentage of those who will say hi to me jumped from 3% in China to 90% in Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>It doesn’t matter how close they are or what they are doing at the time, </p>
  <p>almost everyone on the road waves at me and says hi when I pass by. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070706.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In the case I didn’t notice the waving, they will whistle to grab my attention, and then wave to me with smile.</p>
  <p>If they are playing by the stream, they even invite me come down to swim. </p>
  <p>Some nearly undressed guys who were hiding from the sun in the shadow of the tree also invites me to take a rest with him. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070765.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If I said &quot;Jiakesma&quot; (hello in Kazakh) to them, more than half of the time they will invite me to take a rest and talk with them.</p>
  <p>But.. I don't understand them. With the silly smile on my face, </p>
  <p>I can only point at the direction I am heading to confirm if I am heading Alma-ata or not. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070735.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is kind of crazy to realize that there are so few road sign along the way, and no way to know the name of the road (or they are all unnamed). </p>
  <p>Not even a sign to indicate the distance. Back in China, there is a distance sign every kilometer. In Kazakhstan, nothing. </p>
  <p>With roads without name and distance sign, even if I happened to have a detailed map of Kazakhstan in hand, </p>
  <p>I can hardly imagine how it can help me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070732.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Although the condition of this road is not perfect, there are a lot of roadside trees. It is cozy to ride in the shadows. </p>
  <p>The Kazakhs have good driving manners. No honking all the way, headlights on during the day, it is pretty safe to drive this way. </p>
  <p>You can see the cute vintage sedans all around this place. </p>
  <p>They normally comes with luggage on the top of the roof. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070753.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Most of the bus stations are very well decorated. </p>
  <p>There are embossed graphics on the wall, colorful and interesting. All the graphics on the bus stops are different. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070698.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Sometimes you can see this by the road. The flower makes it looks like a headstone, but it is much less frightening. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070702.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Time to time there are people selling apricot along the road. </p>
  <p>If you do not want to pay for it you also have the option to take it from the trees yourself. The trees are full of apricot. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070737.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Selling apricot still seems normal to me. </p>
  <p>Some kids will put a table by the road and put a water bottle and two bowls. Are they selling water? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070734.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since I don’t read a word of Kazakh, there is no way to tell what the sign means. </p>
  <p>However, I kind of get the feeling on which signs stand for coffee and store after some time.</p>
  <p>In front of a place with white curtain and two kid drinking soft drink I stop my bike. </p>
  <p>Although there is no sign, I got the feeling that this is a store. I am terribly hungry and thirsty now. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070712.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>My instinct did not fail me. Despite the few goods to choose from, this is no doubt a store. </p>
  <p>Since I don’t understand the price she said, I gave the shop lady 200 Tenge for a coke. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070709.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>She gave me a some changes the size of NTD one dollar. </p>
  <p>The copper colored one is 10 Tenge, and the silver colored one is 20 Tenge. This coke costs me 80 Tenge.</p>
  <p>I sat down at the door and drank the coke. Except for the trademark, all the texts on the bottle are Kazakh. </p>
  <p>The coke still tastes the same even though I don't understand what it says on the bottle.</p>
  <p>Turn back into the store; I want a bag of cracker. </p>
  <p>With the changes in my hand, I ask the shop lady take the money for the cracker. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070710.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>My breakfast is a banana and juice flavored milk, lunch is coke and a bag of cracker. </p>
  <p>If I am still hungry, I still have some crackers in my bag.</p>
  <p>There are some stores that looks like coffee shop with light food, but I did not stop for it. </p>
  <p>I merely guessing what the sign says and ride by. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070723.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I do not know where to stay today. There are so few towns along the way, so whenever I saw a people around, </p>
  <p>I take my notebook out and point to the word &quot;Hotel&quot; in Kazakh. </p>
  <p>This is faster than trying to pronounce the word. Sadly, the answer is always no. </p>
  <p>With no luck I decided to back to the road. I would rather enjoy in the hotel for the first day in this new country. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070775.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This looks like a mansion owned by a rich guy. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070726.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>3 PM in the afternoon, I arrived at a larger town.</p>
  <p> A few guys summon me when I was biking around the place looking for hotel. </p>
  <p>They find out that I don’t speak Kazakh soon enough. With the notebook in hand, </p>
  <p>I asked them if there are any hotels around this place. The answer is no. </p>
  <p>The guy grabs a stick and draws the map on the ground. I need to leave this town and turn right, </p>
  <p>keep going straight at the circle for quite some time before I can find a hotel. </p>
  <p>Oh my freaking god. I am already totally exhausted. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070760.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Another guy find out that my water bottle is empty, and take me to the pump for refill. </p>
  <p>This is just like a gift from the above. I filled my stomach with water and then the water bottles.</p>
  <p>It is so easy to get thirsty in Kazakhstan, and I am sweating all the time. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070762.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The guy at the right leads me to the water; the guy on the left drew me the map. </p>
  <p>The guy in the middle just comes for the photo shot. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070763.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Following the guide, all I can see is desolate land. With 70 kilometer between town and town,</p>
  <p> there is nothing in between. The Kazakhstan is really a large country. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070817.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070820.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070821.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I soon feel a bit of tired on the first day biking here. Thinking of how long I have to pedal before I found a town with a hotel. </p>
  <p>Will I need to camp in the wild at the very first day here? </p>
  <p>The water bottle emptied very soon. I kept one last sip of water in the bottle in case I really need to camp outside.</p>
  <p> At that time this sip of water will become the critical sip. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070789.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I crossed a river along the road. There are sandbars in the middle of the river. </p>
  <p>After the such a long time of existence, it is covered with a forest. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070804.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070815.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>However, there are some strange machines hidden inside the forest. Not so pleasant to the eye. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070795.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The sun starts to set at 8 PM. Since I already adds two hours to the clock, the sunset time back to normal again. </p>
  <p>However, I still do not know how far the town is under the setting sun. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070824.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Now I have changed my target from hotel to good campgrounds. </p>
  <p>When I look across the bush, I thought I saw a house. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070826.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It turns out that it is really a house. This is a small village named Bahade.</p>
  <p>Now that hotel is not my main concern. Store and restaurant is much more important to me now. </p>
  <p>It got to be easier to find the two things than a hotel? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070830.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Bahade is not a large town. In fact, it is a small and vintage place.</p>
  <p> I am not very certain that I can find a store or restaurant here. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070832.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070834.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Now I am starting to get used to be &quot;summoned&quot; by the resident aside the road. </p>
  <p>Normally they will not just stop after saying &quot;hi&quot;, they except at least some conversation. </p>
  <p>This time I don’t need the notebook. </p>
  <p>I take out my water bottle, open it and turn it upside down. Not even a drop. </p>
  <p>Then I start to act like I need water. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070835.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>They now know the thing I am looking for is the store. </p>
  <p>By following their direction, I arrive at a place with no sign. There is a young man standing by the door. </p>
  <p>Talking about the store. Without their direction, I can never find it in this town. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070837.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In to the store, drink is the first I want. I bought two iced large sprites at a time, </p>
  <p>and finish one whole bottle before getting out of the door. </p>
  <p>Seems like few people do it this way in here. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070841.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The mother of this house finished her walk with her beautiful daughter. </p>
  <p>They saw me and Dido, and made a gesture like eating and sleeping and invite me in. </p>
  <p>I was originally thinking of getting supply and go camping, but in the end I were treated for one night of stay in the house by the Kazakhs. </p>
  <p>How lucky I am. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>First thing first. I washed my face and find out that there are several bugs died on my face. </p>
  <p>I almost freaked out seeing so many bugs and flies along the road. </p>
  <p>I may need more practice with this water dispenser. </p>
  <p>To get the water you don’t twist the rod under the water tank, instead you push it upwards. </p>
  <p>I felt much relieved after I washed my face. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070843.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is a large family with four kids. Two elder sons are already married, and already made some more grandchildren. </p>
  <p>The only son that is still single is the one just standing by the door. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070844.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070852.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>His name is &quot;Falehahte&quot; . He is a first sergeant, and speaks a bit of English. That is how we communicate. </p>
  <p>When I was taking a rest under the roof, the mother of the family &quot;Maya&quot; is busy preparing my dinner. </p>
  <p>Since everyone else already had their dinner, this one is exclusive for me. </p>
  <p>The main course of the dinner is a kind of grain that I can not name. They call it &quot;Gelijuga&quot;. </p>
  <p>It goes well with the slight scent of the potatoes. </p>
  <p>Side with a lot of freshly picked apricot, big cookie that is very hard to the teeth,</p>
  <p> a whole plate of candy and cookies, black tea and cube, this is indeed a satisfying dinner. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070859.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I start asking question while I am eating. I want to know the name of the other family member. </p>
  <p>Falahate told me and I record it onto my notebook in Chinese. </p>
  <p>I am quite stuffed after finish a pile of Gelijuga. </p>
  <p>Falahate took me to the only coffee shop in town, which is considered the modern architecture here. </p>
  <p>And I learned one more Kazakh here. Beer is called &quot;Piwa&quot; in Kazakh.</p>
  <p> This is quite handy, since I might need one after a long day. Now that at least know how to ask for one. </p>
  <p>I also learned the word that I have fingered on for the whole day. Hotel is pronounced &quot;Gasinzha&quot; in Kazakh. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070868.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Falehate and I drank a whole glass of draft beer in this place. </p>
  <p>The beer tastes very bitter and is totally not my cup of beer. </p>
  <p>However I still said &quot;Jahez!&quot;, which means great taste, to be polite. </p>
  <p>Sitting in the coffee shop, I can no longer see the setting sun. </p>
  <p>On my way back I was thinking whether I should sleep at the dinner place, or take my sleeping bag and sleep by the door. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Falahate took me into the house. The parents are watching TV, with their grandson in hand. </p>
  <p>This is such a pretty and warm home. There are carpets hanging on the wall and lay on the ground. </p>
  <p>Falahate take me to the second floor, which is quite a comfy room. </p>
  <p>They even put up clean sheets and blanket cover for me. Tonight I have a roof above me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070871.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since I am all sticky and sweaty, I asked this stupid question. &quot;Do Kazakhs take showers each day?&quot;</p>
  <p>The answer is yes. After my room is ready, it's the happy shower time. </p>
  <p>First heat some water in large pot, and put in cold water in smaller buckets. </p>
  <p>It was like a I born again after I get out of the bathroom. </p>
  <p>It is already dark outside now. I will leave these dirty close to tomorrow. </p>
  <p>I have also checked the directions during dinner. I have 250 kilometers ahead before I arrive at Alma-ata.</p>
  <p>I can find a place with hotel after about 150 kilometers. The plan is buy a map after I hit the major city, Alma-ata. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I also find out another interesting thing. If I did not turn in to Bahade from the main road, </p>
  <p>after 3 kilometer I will arrive at another town, which is larger and comes with a hotel. </p>
  <p>Falahate said this during the dinner. </p>
  <p>&quot;You can find a hotel ahead, but it costs money. Today you stay in our place, free. Stay.&quot; </p>
  <p>Kazakhs are inviting, cute, friendly and passionate. </p>
  <p>Despite the fact that their road sucks, their signs are a mess, I like Kazakhstan very much. </p>
  <p>The first day in Kazakhstan ends peacefully. With all the fatigue I have with me, </p>
  <p>I fall at sleep in spilt seconds after I get on the bed. </p>
