  <p class="style5">How do you spell HOTEL in Kazakh</p>
  <p align="center">Wow!  Not even 5 o’clock in the morning, I had already gotten up, climbed out of my  tent, </p>
  <p align="center">which had no insulation effect whatsoever. </p>
  <p align="center"> I washed my face with the freezing water, and  found my eyes bags were as big as walnuts, </p>
  <p align="center">thanks to those “sleepless” truck  drivers.</p>
  <p>I went into the restaurant and found that waitress had  the same eyes bags like mine.  </p>
  <p>Thanks for  her kindness; she brought me a pot of hot milk tea, </p>
  <p>which warmed me up from my  heart to every single part of my body.  And  she even refused to let me pay for it. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">I  filled up my three water bottles before took off. It was really a great thing  to travel in a country that tap water is drinkable. </p>
  <p align="center">I remembered when I biked  in France,  I might not pay attention to all the beautiful scenery in that country, </p>
  <p align="center">but the  instinct of looking for drinking water never failed me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070993.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I should get going now,  6:30 in the morning. </p>
  <p>It was better to leave early, plus the weather was cooler,  I hoped I can keep this good habit.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was downhill after  leaving Koback (phonetic translation), </p>
  <p>this long ride totally swept away my  frustration from yesterday.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1070998.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">I  was not complaining about the uphill biking experience, but the road condition  in Kazakhstan  was terrible, </p>
  <p align="center">so the experience here was really tiresome and frustrating.</p>
  <p>Today was different. Not only I was biking downhill,  and the road condition was great, and the air was fresh.  </p>
  <p>Well, except the birds flying above my head  like crazy, as if they were practicing some routines. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080003.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Talking about the birds, I  have to tell you my first impression about this country.  </p>
  <p>This was my third day in Kazakhstan; I was already very  impressed about the terrible road condition, </p>
  <p>and the dead animal bodies, such  as porcupine, cat, dog but mostly birds, everywhere. </p>
  <p>You can recognize some  birds by the shape, but lots of them can be only identified by the feathers  lying on the ground.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In China, construction workers  repairing the road were a usual sight when I biked, but there was none here.  </p>
  <p>This one was supposed to be one of the major highways, but if in China, this  could only be at the best the country road.   </p>
  <p>It seems like once the road built, no maintenance is necessary.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080014.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">My “happy  hour” was gone as soon as I finished the downhill part of the road, </p>
  <p align="center">now I was  climbing up, and the road condition was “down”.</p>
  <p align="center">Since  there was still 160 km to Almaty, I didn’t want to force myself to finish that  in one day, </p>
  <p align="center">which meant, I would just take it easy. I would like to have a good  night sleep if I could find any nice place to spend the night.</p>
  <p>I didn’t want to BUY any more maps at all, especially  if I can find the big city without much problem. </p>
  <p>The map would be labeled with  names of the city, not the roads or the directions. </p>
  <p>I was pretty confident that  I could easily get my direction with that 10-tenge map and the Google Earth.  </p>
  <p>Well, unless the next part of the country I was going to ride has a better  road/highway system, </p>
  <p>then I might consider to get a new map. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080030.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There were three donkeys  waiting for the bus? I was laughing so badly that I almost fell down from my  bike.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080021.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I couldn’t stop myself but  buying 100 tenges of prunes.  </p>
  <p>I didn’t  want to buy too many, so I gave out my biggest coin, 100 tenges. </p>
  <p>But from her  face, it seemed like they usually sell that by bucket, she was calculating how  many this 100 tenge could buy. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080035.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Well, let me help. I found a plastic bag from my  pack, and handed to her. She thought about it and gave me lots of prunes.</p>
  <p>Those prunes were neither  sweet nor sour. </p>
  <p>The lady showed me how to eat the stuff inside the pit, by cracking  it with rocks. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080045.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Other than prunes, you can also buy drinks, but I was guessing  this was not for me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080029.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Sometimes kids would run  after me for fun. Most of the bikes in Kazakhstan have their wheels  </p>
  <p>decorated with colorful plastic stuff; this one was relatively “plain”so  to speak.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080040.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">I was riding my bike and eating my prunes, and I  thought I should still stop for this old time friendly place—gas station.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080046.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I didn’t want coke anymore,  so I bought myself a liter of orange juice, to replenish my vitamin C. </p>
  <p>I also got  a chocolate bar and a pack of crackers.   </p>
  <p>I was trying to understand the “money culture” from the great varieties  of bills I got back from the casher.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080049.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080050.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">I  knew to cool down was not enough for me, what I really needed now was sleep. </p>
  <p align="center">I  didn’t get much of sleep at all last night.</p>
  <p align="center">However,  I finally adjusted myself back to an “early bird” mode; I didn’t want to spend  my morning to SLEEP. </p>
  <p align="center">So, maybe, I should continue riding my bike until noon? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I leaned a couple of new  Kazakh words everyday, today were “one” and “bike”. </p>
  <p>I also tried to correct the  pronunciation of the words I learned earlier. </p>
  <p>The language was only useful if  other people can understand what I was saying. </p>
  <p>I wanted to practice them enough  that I could say them out any time I need to, without thinking it first, I  mean.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">The  dogs were not a rare sight in Kazakhstan;  I was run after by 4 dogs today, luckily not the big or evil type. </p>
  <p align="center">I usually  “barked” back at them to scare them away.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I missed the days when I biked in China, which  was “dogless”. </p>
  <p>I was pretty nervous now whenever I heard any suspicious sound  at my back. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">I  finally found an abandoned gas station to take a nap around noon. </p>
  <p align="center">There was  many sheep’s dung here, but no flies were attracted since there was no stinky  smell.</p>
  I had such a good nap that I thought I could almost  live here, as long as I get my good sleep.
  <p><img src="photo/P1080062.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Around 1 o’clock, I did  some grocery shopping, and lunch too. </p>
  <p>I saw a carton of “milk” in the refrigerator,  and it turned out that was yogurt. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080064.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">Thank  god that I was not exactly expecting that was milk, otherwise, I would probably  throw up after my first sip.</p>
  <p>Oh, I also got myself an ice bar. Scanning through  every aisle, </p>
  <p>I really couldn’t find anything interesting for lunch, so I ended  up getting an instant noodle and a pack of crackers. </p>
  <p>Instant noodle was more or  less the same everywhere I went, just another choice for lunch. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080068.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I passed several towns on  the way to Almaty. </p>
  <p>Some with signs but no sight, I guessed that was because  lots of towns were not near the highway, </p>
  <p>you needed to make turns to find it.  As many towns passed by, all I could see were grocery stores, </p>
  <p>coffee shops, or  vegetable stands. But where was the hotel?   </p>
  <p>I asked at lest three people before I believed that there was NO hotel at  every town I stopped.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080098.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>“Be aware of running pedestrians!”  Never saw this kind of sign before. </p>
  <p>Kazakhs drive fast and crazy.  Most of the cares were antique cars, not many  trucks.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080100.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>You usually could find  “bike only” lane, but the road condition was just “terrible”. </p>
  <p>Even though the  bike only lane was mostly shaded, the horrible road condition still put me off  most of the time. </p>
  <p>I usually just bring my bike back to the regular highway.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080078.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>These were the produce. I  thought Kazakh people don’t like to plant stuff, </p>
  <p>and that is why so many lands  were empty. But, see? You can actually find most what you need here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080090.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">It  was almost like an outdoor supermarket, I wanted to buy everything, but I  didn’t get anything. </p>
  <p align="center">I couldn’t believe they even sold inflatable water toys, I  was wondering: </p>
  <p align="center">WHERE was the water that you could play those toys in?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080095.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">Actually,  I didn’t particularly care if I could find a hotel for the night or not. </p>
  <p align="center">What I  really wanted was a place to wash my clothes. </p>
  <p align="center">I kind of started to disgust my  own clothes at this point. I sweated everyday; I was wet from top to bottom.  </p>
  <p align="center">Yes, don’t take me wrong.  Of course I  had every intention to wear clean outfit, </p>
  <p align="center">but I couldn’t find any place to wash  the dirty ones. </p>
  <p align="center">I did rub my body clean everyday before going to sleep, buy my  </p>
  <p align="center">“clean” body soon then was covered by those filthy clothes that I wore over and  over. </p>
  <p align="center">Sometimes I could even breathe my own stinky smell while biking.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I needed hotel for its  water to wash my clothes, and its space to dry my clothes after I washed them.  </p>
  <p>I would be thrilled if I could even take a nice shower and have a good nice  sleep.  </p>
  <p>As a matter of fact, I wouldn’t  mind camping everyday as long as </p>
  <p>I have unlimited supplies of fresh and clean  clothes at the same time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Some people have houses like this: with number marked on  the tree trunk, </p>
  <p>with a simple gate as the “entrance”, and the little path  before entering the real house, </p>
  <p>which was hidden in the deep end of the woods.  </p>
  <p>I saw many houses with similar arrangement, as if they were playing  hide-and-seek.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080101.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">Well,  I was thirsty again, time to get a drink. I was a bit sick of juice now, </p>
  <p align="center">that  was why I got milk instead at noon. </p>
  <p align="center">Uh… I wondered what was inside this big  white bottle; I saw kids drank that earlier, </p>
  <p align="center">so I asked the cashier how was  that thing taste like. </p>
  <p align="center">Well, of course he said, “great!” why did I even bother  to ask?  I got one anyway.  </p>
  <p align="center">I heard a pop sound when I twisted the lid,  which made me wonder if that was some kind of carbonated water. </p>
  <p align="center">Very carefully  (don’t ask me why), I took the first sip. </p>
  <p align="center">I almost threw up right there… It was  sour and strong, and the cashier dared to say that tastes great!  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080106.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">He looked me and suggested me to shake it  before I drink it. </p>
  <p align="center">As far as I could understand, this thing was a fermentation  product of milk,</p>
  <p align="center"> after some who-knows-what process, it became a bubbling yogurt  drink, </p>
  <p align="center">which was definitely not my cup of tea. I bet some game show can use  this as a penalty drink for “losers”, </p>
  <p align="center">no modifications necessary.</p>
  <p>Well, I didn’t want to drink it and I didn’t want to  throw it away, either. </p>
  <p>Luckily, there was a homeless(?) guy just outside of the  door, </p>
  <p>I gave him the whole bottle, saved me a lot of trouble. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080108.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Finally, around 6 in the  evening, I saw a sign showing very familiar letter arrangement. </p>
  <p>I flipped open  my notebook, bingo. That sign said, “HOTEL”.</p>
  <p align="center">Thank  god that I got some useful information about Kazakhstan in my forum before I  entered this country.  </p>
  <p align="center">Otherwise, there  was no way I could guess this spells “hotel” at all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080112.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I asked for the rate, and I  got a table. I could see the numbers and room number, </p>
  <p>but what was the things  on the first row? 1, 2, 3, more and more? Meant the number of people? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080111.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">Anyway,  of course I pointed to the cheapest one, and put out one finger (index finger)  to say I was alone, 700 tenges.  </p>
  <p align="center">Not too  bad, actually.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then… this was totally a  misunderstanding. She thought I wanted to stay for one HOUR, not the one NIGHT.  </p>
  <p>The number indicated 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 1 night and 2 nights. </p>
  <p>Therefore, I paid  my 2500 tenges for a night, which was relatively expensive compared to that in  China, </p>
  <p>but kind of cheap if it is in Taiwan.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080114.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The first thing I did was  to take a nice shower. </p>
  <p>The bathroom in my room has only shower available (no  toilet), which was exactly what I needed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080116.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">After  cleaning myself from head to toe, I soaked my dirty clothes in hot water and  laundry detergent, </p>
  <p align="center">and then air-dried them somewhere in the backyard.</p>
  <p>I was determined to get my 2500 tenges worth. </p>
  <p>I wanted  to do the way the Fleck and Jacquin couple did, which was camping as much as  possible in Kazakhstan.  </p>
  <p>I would only go to hotel when I couldn’t stand  my own stinky smell anymore, for example, today. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080118.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">Since  the hotel rate is rather high here, this seemed to be the way to reduce the  expensive.</p>
  <p>There was only 30 kms away from Almaty, which I could imagine  the expense could go only higher, </p>
  <p>why not spent the night here, which is  cheaper. </p>
  <p>As to tomorrow, I would  stay with a friend’s house IF I could find that address, </p>
  <p>otherwise, I would  keep moving to the west side of the city, to save money.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">There  were not so many policemen around in this country. </p>
  <p align="center">Not that I needed their  help, but it felt kind of weird since they were everywhere in China. </p>
  <p align="center">If  anything happened in China,  you just waited there patiently, eventually, some police will come by. </p>
  <p align="center">That was  not the case here at all. The first police I saw was after I settled down at  this hotel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080122.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Well, their car was OK, kind of like a toy. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080134.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">I  had my dinner at the restaurant.  As  usual, I opened the menu, and asked them to order for me. </p>
  <p align="center">And the surprise  dinner was “bread, milk tea and beef noodle”. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080119.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center"> This was similar to what I had at Amazhen’s house, </p>
  <p align="center">but  it FELT better when served with some elegant utensils. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080131.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">For  the beef noodle, the waiter even brought me a pair of chopsticks, very nice.</p>
  <p>People always told me that Kazakhstan has cheap meat, </p>
  <p>but  expensive vegetable before I entered this country. I always doubted that, until  now. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080126.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>These bread and beef noodle  couldn’t fill up my hungry stomach, so I ordered what other people ordered:  mini-dumplings.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080130.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The size of these dumplings  was about 1/3 of the regular size that you usually see in China. </p>
  <p>They actually  looked more like the dumplings/fishballs that we eat in hot pot in Taiwan, and  they tasted really good.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080132.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This type of mini-dumplings  was actually very common in any supermarket here. </p>
  <p>Including 10 % of service  charge, this dinner cost me 690 tenges, which is about 200 NTD, </p>
  <p>which made me  wish that I was still in China.  Please send me back to China, the low expense heaven.</p>
