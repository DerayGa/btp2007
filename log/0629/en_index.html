  <p class="style5">Manager in Decaying Kepa</p>
  <p>It rained for the whole night last night, but stopped when I got up at dawn. </p>
  <p>Cars on the road made a sound of water splashing when swooshing by.</p>
  <p>Even though the heavy rain had stopped, water puddles were everywhere.</p>
  <p>Last night I slept in Nemat’s dorm room, a tiny place with two beds, one desk, and walls full of beauty posters from magazines.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080220.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In the early morning everybody was still asleep. The iron gate of the restaurant was locked, and so was Dido. </p>
  <p>I managed to find a person sleeping in the storage room to unlock Dido.</p>
  <p>Getting Dido back and changing clothes, I was asked if I would like to eat something or drink some tea.</p>
  <p>Looking at my watch, it was still quite early. Everybody was either still asleep or not at work yet. </p>
  <p>In order not to trouble anyone, I decided to eat along the road later.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080219.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While doing my nightly routine before sleep, I found my toothbrush and toothpaste were gone. </p>
  <p>I recollected that they were left on the sink vanity in the hotel room where I stayed the day before yesterday.</p>
  <p>Without brushing teeth properly, it would be troublesome that my toothache would come back. I just recovered…</p>
  <p>Flossing and gargling thoroughly, I would buy a new toothbrush and toothpaste when I next saw some shops. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080230.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Riding along the well-paved main road, it even had a shoulder as a bike lane for me to ride on. </p>
  <p>I wanted to stay on this road.</p>
  <p>Could it be possible that that main road would take me to Almaty and all the way up to Astana?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080233.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After a short ride, a few gas stations and a signboard with “hotel, 50 meters ahead” were in sight. </p>
  <p>If I had not slept in the restaurant last night, it could have been quite a different night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080221.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Having breakfast at the roadside restaurant around 9:00am, I still did not read the menu but asked the waiter to order for me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080268.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The table setting was western style and always with a very large sugar jar. </p>
  <p>The only thing I knew how to order was “tea”. Tea with sugar tasted good and helped me recover.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080269.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I got a set meal including stew potato, chicken, salad and rice stopped with white sauce – a good portion, and palatable.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080274.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was funny that when the store staff found out that I did not speak Kazak, he asked if I spoke English. </p>
  <p>I nodded happily and said yes. Did anybody here speak English? </p>
  <p>The answer was “no”.</p>
  <p>If so, why did you ask me if I spoke English?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Kazak way of calculating bills is interesting as well. In China, the number was always rounded off. </p>
  <p>For example, if a meal was 493 RMB, the bill would be 490 RMB.</p>
  <p>In Kazakhstan, everything was rounded up, do there was no change back if 500 KZT was handed over for 493 KZT.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The roadside rest area was also not too shabby, it had places for eating and shopping. </p>
  <p>After getting new toothbrush and toothpaste, I was off.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080277.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Continuing on the main road, when I saw a policeman standing by the road, </p>
  <p>I pointed my hand forward and loudly asked “Asatana?”</p>
  <p>He shook his head.</p>
  <p>What happened was if I kept riding on this road, I would be heading south and entering Kyrgyzstan in two days.</p>
  <p>I had to backtrack to get to Almaty. </p>
  <p>Turning back upset me quite a bit. Fine then, I would continue on and turn to the north when I had a chance.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080228.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Seeing a person in a car wreck on the road side in the distance, I was quite nervous. </p>
  <p>I had been seeing animals’ bodies along the way, but please don’t let me see a human body.</p>
  <p>Thank god, that person was a healthy man who was dismantling the car and salvaging the auto parts.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080279.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Graffiti on the wall – I could only understand the ♥ and the text smiley :-). Was that love talk?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080286.jpg" width="900" height="506" /> </p>
  <p>The map in Chinese was useless and I could not read the road sign in Kazak. </p>
  <p>The only tool could navigate with was my compass. </p>
  <p>It silently showed me that I was moving toward midway between west and southwest.</p>
  <p>I was lost terribly, so the heaven sent me an angel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080296.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A motorcyclist passed by. He stopped and asked me if I spoke English. </p>
  <p>Yes, I did. He indeed spoke English not just asking for fun.</p>
  <p>Yingo, from Scandinavia, had traveled for five weeks on his beloved heavy motorcycle and had done 10,000 km. </p>
  <p>We both were heading for Moscow but on different routes.</p>
  <p>I felt embarrassed to tell him that I was lost. </p>
  <p>Yingo checked on his map and told me that I was not terribly lost, </p>
  <p>continuing on another 20 km, I could turn right toward the north, riding another 100 km to get back to the right road.</p>
  <p>Taking a picture of the map for future reference, I saw a place named Kepa, and expected it to be today’s lodging.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080295.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The attractive structures with castle-like pointed towers are actually tombs. </p>
  <p>They look more luxurious than the houses where the alive people live.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080298.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Before turning right to adjust my direction, I bought one liter of apple juice.</p>
  <p>I had no idea if there would be towns to get supplies along the way. </p>
  <p>Usually I was as sparing of water as possible. </p>
  <p>Once a shop or a gas station appeared, I would buy one liter of beverage and quaffed it real quick.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080312.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I stopped for a drink and to catch my breath before leaving the well-paved main road and continued on the minor road</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080308.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Once I hit the minor road, the road became lousy and was full of potholes. What happened? Did a meteor strike the road?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080346.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080336.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Not an easy ride, but the scenery along the road was beautiful. </p>
  <p>Golden grass was on both sides of the road. I had no idea they were pastures or weeds, </p>
  <p>they were beautiful and waving in the wind like a golden sea.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080323.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080330.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080337.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080340.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Getting on a side road, it was less than 30 km away from Kepa. </p>
  <p>Halfway, I was stopped by three cops with gold crowned teeth in their mouths in a sedan.</p>
  <p>Policemen did not drive police cars. No wonder I did not see any police cars running along the road. </p>
  <p>I thought they stopped me to cheer me up or something. It turned out that they wanted to check on my passport.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080347.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While they were browsing my passport, I asked for Kepa information.<br />
    I made a gesture of sleeping - any hotel in Kepa? Everybody shook their heads.<br />
    Then, a gesture for eating – any restaurant in Kepa? They still shook their heads.<br />
    REALLY? What a miserable place. <br />
  Then, a gesture for drinking – it could not be possible that Kepa had no shops? Finally everybody nodded.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080374.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Passing a small lake along the road, I would say it was not a lake but a pond of flood water. </p>
  <p>The water was not clear so I had no desire to soak my feet. After taking a picture, I was off.</p>
  <p>Dido was propped against a short tree with stiff branches. </p>
  <p>I hit my head on the branches a few times and had to bend over to walk Dido out.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080362.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Everything gave way to the flat landscape stretching as far one could see. </p>
  <p>Kepa was in sight and looked nice in the distance.</p>
  <p>There were many small houses and some storage-like structures. I thought to myself, “shouldn’t it be not too backward?”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080376.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When arriving in Kepa, I could not happily tell Dido that we had arrived. </p>
  <p>The reason was this town had deteriorated so badly.</p>
  <p>The noisy birds in the sky were all crows. This town is located at the intersection of a road and a railroad. </p>
  <p>How could it fall apart to such an unacceptable degree?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080383.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080389.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I got up to the bridge crossing over the railroad, a shepherd boy cried out loud, </p>
  <p>running over and talking to me in the language I did not understand at all – it sounded exotic, didn’t it?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080391.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was not romantic whatsoever, his body language made me understand what he was saying.</p>
  <p>He made a gesture of smoking – do you have cigarettes? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080400.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Getting into Kepa, empty streets and falling apart houses, most of which were abandoned.</p>
  <p>There were a huge power facility and an abandoned factory house. </p>
  <p>It seemed that this place was once prosperous with industry. How did it become today’s decaying town?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080405.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Finally spotting a person, I made a gesture of drinking, asking where I could find a shop?</p>
  <p>He led me all the way to the decaying town and then opened up the factory’s iron gate. </p>
  <p>Inside, all were large broken rusted machines. He gave me a PET bottle with water in it.</p>
  <p>That was not what I was looking for, a shop, but I appreciated the water. </p>
  <p>Filling up my water bottles, and drinking some water, I spoke in Kazak with poor pronunciation “where is there a shop?”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080409.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080412.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>He pointed somewhere in the town and offered to take me over. </p>
  <p>I walked Dido following him, but he gestured me to leave Dido and I could sleep here tonight as well. </p>
  <p>He was the first person I met in the little town. I just wanted to ask for information about a shop. </p>
  <p>It turned out that he took me home and let me stay for one night. Fate was indeed something marvelous.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080415.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The person who took me in for tonight was named Guyweidian. He watched the abandoned factory.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080421.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080425.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I bought one liter of orange juice, two liters of cola, a few bags of instant noodles </p>
  <p>and a big bag of bread at the only shop in town. After rounding up, I paid 580 KZT.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080430.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since I saw Guyweidian boiling water, I thought of buying a few bags of instant noodles. </p>
  <p>Noodles accompanied by bread and cola sounded a nice meal.</p>
  <p>Back in Guyweidian’s dorm, only he and his dog were left in this enormous factory large enough to employ more than 1,000 people.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080435.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080410.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While water was boiling on the stove, I offered the instant noodles,</p>
  <p> but Guyweidian seemed to have another idea for dinner.</p>
  <p>Before dinner, he took me to a place with a big water tube where cold water ran. </p>
  <p>He said the water was not drinkable but I could take a sponge bath – excellent!</p>
  <p>I fetched my towel and clothes first, cleaned up myself, and did my laundry. </p>
  <p>The clothes were not washed in soapy water, but it was better than not washing at all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080433.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The washed clothes were hung up to dry at the abandoned deck where nothing had left.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080436.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The dinner was white, short and thin noodles seasoned with black pepper and salt topped with sliced onion </p>
  <p>– looked normal but amazingly delicious.</p>
  <p>The sheep-poop-like pellets in my hot tea were in fact processed tea. I added a few teaspoons of sugar.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080446.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The abandoned factory did not have power and water. There were tens of PET bottles in various sizes containing water. </p>
  <p>I had no idea the source of the water though.</p>
  <p>Without power, the pictures were quickly uploaded and stored in my computer. </p>
  <p>Hopefully I would find a place to recharge my camera, cell phone and other stuff needing power.</p>
  <p>I had given up upon Internet already. As long as I could get online once in Kazakhstanduring the month of travel, I would be content.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080420.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After dinner, Guyweidian gave me a tour of the abandoned factory. </p>
  <p>I did not understand what he said, but my guess was this place was a cement factory.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080457.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080459.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Tens of tall and huge silos lined side by side. The structure in the center seemed to be the control tower. </p>
  <p>Nothing left in the tower except pigeon poop, feathers, and dead bodies.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080492.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As the rusted front door was opened, the birds were frightened and flew away – they were totally startled.</p>
  <p>How long would a factory take to decay to a condition like such? 3 years, 5 years?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080463.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After entering the dirty factory house, we climbed up the steep stairs. </p>
  <p>If you fell down the stairs, you stepped on nothing but bird poop.</p>
  <p>The rail I needed to hold onto was also covered with bird poop. It was dangerous not to hold onto the rail.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080468.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080481.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because the factory went down, Kepa was affected and went down with it, </p>
  <p>even though Kepa had the intersection of the railroad and the main road.</p>
  <p>Today, there was no traffic on the road, and no train ever stopped. </p>
  <p>I could image how relatively prosperous the town had been, but it had been long forgotten now.</p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ya6WYXyREFY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080484.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I could not think of a reason why people were still staying here, perhaps they could not let go.</p>
  <p>The crows squawking and spiraling in the sky the whole day sounded sad and dead.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080473.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The abandoned factory had its own railroad, now it was overgrown with weeds. </p>
  <p>The rusted railway tracks lay on the ground like a skeleton rotten with time.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080496.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Guyweidian watched the abandoned factory by himself. </p>
  <p>Even he was alone, some kids or ex-coworkers would come to chat with him at times. He was not too lonely after all.</p>
  <p>He was a 35 year old married man. His wife and two kids lived in a major city.</p>
  <p>He did not have much to do except locking up every door and witnessing the buildings decaying day after day.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080500.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>At 9:00pm, I laid my sleeping bag on the bed and was ready to sleep. </p>
  <p>He was outside busy hammering nails till late night</p>
  <p>Kepa was like today’s sunset – sentimental and lonely with the smell of death –  beautiful but brief. Glory does not last long.</p>
