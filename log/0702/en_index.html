  <p class="style5">Village Hill</p>
  <p>After a  delightful shower, I had a good sleep in this comfortable room. </p>
  <p>In the morning,  I acted as a little child - didn’t want to get out of bed; </p>
  <p>I didn’t know when I  will have a chance to sleep on a bed again.</p>
  <p>        Taking  this infrequently resource again after got out of the bad, I took a shower one  more time. </p>
  <p>Next few days I probably won’t have any chance to take any shower.</p>
  <p>After packaged  my stuff, I saw the restaurant was being opened. The restaurant is opened for  breakfast also.</p>
  <p>        I  walked to kitchen directly to see what kind of food I liked that was faster and  convenience comparing looked at menu. </p>
  <p>There was sound coming from a pan; the  chef was frying meat in a pan; the air was filled with delicacies smell.</p>
  <p>        I  pointed to the pan; I wanted to have this,  gave it to me, gave it to me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080741.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>        The  owner also cooked 2 eggs and took a big bottle of apple juice from the  refrigerator. </p>
  <p>I hadn’t this type of food, including breads, for a long time.</p>
  <p>        Besides  ate my owner food, I also looked others food from tables around me.</p>
  <p>        The  noodle soup looks like delicious from the table next to me; I ordered the same  soup. </p>
  <p>There are potato, noodle, and chicken meat in the soup; the soup is  delicate.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080744.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>        I  had a full and delectable breakfast. 2 litter of juice could not be finished  before I started to bike; </p>
  <p>I put left juice on the water bottle holder for later  to drink.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        It  was time to go; no matter this was a homely hotel. There is still a long way to  go, </p>
  <p>although I didn’t know where my next destination today is.</p>
  <p>        It  is a burning day; today is almost like yesterday. Unfortunately,</p>
  <p> wind was  blowing this morning and against the wind; it was a hardy morning.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080755.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The only different is the scenery; there is  a lake on the right side of the road. </p>
  <p>Even I was riding along the lake, but the  road is not built beside the lake; I could not always see the lake.</p>
  <p>        Sometimes  the lake is so closed and sometimes not. When it is far away, I even didn’t  know where the lake is. </p>
  <p>If the temperature is too hot, I want to cool down my  body by riding into lake.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080751.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The water plants are flourishing around the  lakeside, just like wetlands. </p>
  <p>There are many different bird sounds; it is  amazingly there are many different types of insects.</p>
  <p>        The  feces were not normal for past few days. Every time I had collywobbles; </p>
  <p>I  needed to find a hidden place to take care of it. Probably all foods, I had  eaten, were already been eaten by flies; </p>
  <p>also the wafer I had drank is strange.  My digestion system was still not acclimatized.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080752.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are more houses on the road when  closer to the Capital; they are a single house on the wold. </p>
  <p>There is a  restaurant, gas station, or hotel around every 10 kilometers.</p>
  <p>        I  could take a brake or buy some food when I needed it. </p>
  <p>Since there are more  stores available, it provides me the calmness of emotion for the rest of the  day.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080798.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is a super mini-hotel;  it is pity and still early for me to stop today’s journey.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080793.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There must be a lot of fishes in the lake;  many fish street venders sell smoke fishes on the road. </p>
  <p>The vendors use a  simple table and a shingle to start their business.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The smoke  fishes are big, and the fishy smell is very heavy. </p>
  <p>I don’t know who to eat them  even if I buy them, but cats must love the fishes very much. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080770.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080773.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Kazakhstan polices always  ask me to stop, but just for talks. After some talks, then let me continue my  trip.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080781.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Today I had passed through a bigger town;  there is a train station. It looks like a prosperous town.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But they  are all the same - the small single house; there are many power poles, junk  cars, used tires. </p>
          <p>The buildings are disappeared.
  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080782.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Before I started the journey this morning,  the restaurant owner gave me some bread as snack. </p>
  <p>The bread with juice was my  lunch at the shadow area of the bus stop.</p>
  <p>The  clothes I washed yesterday were still not dry yet; </p>
  <p>it was a good time to dry  them in the sun during the lunch time. </p>
  <p>Within intense heat and blowing wind,  the clothes were dried quickly. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080778.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As long as drivers saw me in the bus stop,  they always stopped and to check if I needed a free ride.</p>
  <p>        Even  don’t need to thumb a ride on the road side; cars always stop to provide a free  ride. </p>
  <p>Here is a good place for hitchhike.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I started to bike right away after the  lunch. A while later a car with 3 people asked me to stop the bike.</p>
  <p>        They  originally just wanted to have a short talk with me. </p>
  <p>After the short talk and  drove away already, they changed their mind and stopped the car again. </p>
  <p>They  waited for me and liked to have a long talk.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While people are grin from ear to ear, you  can see there are many golden teeth; </p>
  <p>this country must have a good welfare  program for dental. </p>
  <p>Government will pay all false tooth cost when people needed  and only make golden tooth.</p>
  <p>        Took  out my camera for pictures; when they saw the camera, they were so excited and  brought a gun out from the car.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        Is  it legally to own a gun in Kazakhstan?</p>
  <p>        I  was taking pictures with hand shaking; would like adding the note below at the  bottom of the picture.</p>
  <p>        We  have the Dido. If you want it back safely, please bring one million US dollar  to get it back.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080748.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>        Although  the people live in worn-out houses, the cemetery is better and beauty. </p>
  <p>Seeing a  gravestone and grave area from time to time, they are magnificent and  dignified.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080765.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I could see many  people were driving cars and playing water at the lakeside when I was close to  the lake.</p>
  <p>I only dipped my  feet in water when I saw there was clear and cool lake or river. </p>
  <p>This time I  want to find a good place and swim in there; yes, this is my tomorrow’s plan.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Again, there is  another lake without any water. </p>
  <p>If there is water in this lake, this road would  pass through the lake, and the view must be very beautiful and scenic.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080807.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080812.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The sea level for this highway is not high,  but it is in mountain and up/down sloping road. </p>
  <p>The sea level for the road is  between 200 to 300 meters; </p>
  <p>not like in China, the same highway can have 2000  kilometer sea level variance.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        Had  a break at a gas station; there is a convenient store in the station. </p>
  <p>The owner  is smiling happily; will see many golden teeth again in mouth if paying a  little of attention.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080786.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Bought some back up food  here; for easy carrying and high calorie, I bought 5 pieces of peanut chocolate  bar. </p>
  <p>Had the chocolate bars in freezer first, although they will be melted on  the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080788.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Flies are over everywhere, including in gas  station. </p>
  <p>It was impossible for lunch nap here; how can Kazakh stand so many  fries?</p>
  <p>        Kazakh  are unbelievable. Even flies are on their body; they don’t feel flies, just  like flies are not existed. </p>
  <p>I am the only one dispersing flies.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        Besides  flying noise from the flies, biting flies make me mad extremely. </p>
  <p>If I am a  scientist, I must to invent a medicament that can eliminate flies.</p>
  <p>Since I  could not have the nap, continue bicycling toward today’s destination. </p>
  <p>No  matter where my destination is today, there are least 100 kilometers to go; it  is long. </p>
  <p>I felt exhausted. Keep bicycling until I am truly tired. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080792.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>        There  were a lot of clouds today; I had more easy biking time under the shadow. </p>
  <p>From  the picture, you can see it is a nice weather day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        Clouds  were all over the sky until the horizontal; it looks like fake scenery.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080817.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Around 6PM bought a bottle of coke in a  small shop. There is a dog; it didn’t not bark at and chase me, and is  well-behaved.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        Even  though food in the bag was no much left, still gave the dog a hot dog.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080834.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080833.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While looked at the dog  eating the food I gave, I also started to feel hungry. </p>
  <p>The shop owner also has  a restaurant; it is time for dinner.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is a case of eggs and  some crackers on tables; didn’t know these are for sale or just like seasoning  as free.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080836.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Today’s chef’s special was deep fry meat  cake which is mixture of ground meat and onion. </p>
  <p>In order to have a full dinner,  it needs bread also, but this only cost me $200.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The milk  tea after the dinner comes with meal. </p>
  <p>As long as I could stand for flies, it is  a good place for organizing the trip log. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080843.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The chef is daughter in law (left) in this  family. Her name is Natasa and has a child; her husband is in Uzbekistan.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        Young  brother, Falahata (center), 13 years old, he has both bloods of Uzbekistan and  Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p>He was always around me and asking me a lot of questions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mark  (right), 15 years old, looks like not belonging to this family, but living with  this family. </p>
  <p>He is Russian; no one will restrict him. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080848.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Walked around after the meal at the outside  of the restaurant, I was looking for a good location for camping tonight. </p>
  <p>The  flat area under the bridge looks good, although there is much garbage.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        Falahata  asked where I would sleep tonight; I pointed the flat area under the bridge.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He  brought me to their home and showed me the room where they sleep, </p>
  <p>told me I  could sleep here and didn’t need to sleep outside. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080847.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I put Dido at the corner of  the restaurant. Every night I slept at different family; I am embarrassing.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080849.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After the sunset,  restaurant is very busy. </p>
  <p>There are many cars in front of the store; Natasa is  busying to take care of customers.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080855.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I met Falahata at the door;  he led me to climbs up the hill after the village.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080864.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Stood at the top of the  hill, I could see the whole village. </p>
  <p>This is a small village; it cannot be  found from the map. </p>
  <p>You even won’t notice the village while driving by; it  looks yet tiny at the afterglow.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080868.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>        All  adults, like father and Natasa’s husband and Falahata’s brother, are all in  Uzbekistan; </p>
  <p>only women, senior citizens, and children are stay in here and take  care of business. </p>
  <p>Restaurant is even busier after the afterglow;I helped dish  wash to reduce their work load.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Didn’t know how to continue the journey if  there were no helps from nice Kazakh for past days. </p>
  <p>This is an immense  gratitude; at this moment, I only could help this family on dish wash.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        The  place for sleep has a wide bed which is for a number of people. </p>
  <p>I was so happy  there was a fan; unfortunately, the fan was gone at night.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        Natasa  and her family live in a RV; Nasata’s family own at least 70% of property in  the village.</p>
  <p>        The  family also has 1 horse, 2 cattle, 3 dogs, and 4 cats; no matter when, animals  are around you.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1080851.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because slept beside the restaurant, there  were many flies in the room. </p>
  <p>So I slept in my tent in order to insulate from  flies.</p>
  <p>        A  few thousand dollars tent is not porous. Although flies could not annoy me, I  was all wet in the tent. </p>
  <p>My sweat was all over the tent.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>        Sleeping  inside the tent was even hotter than riding bike in the sunny day; </p>
  <p>but as long  as I leaved the tent, flies were flying toward to me.</p>
  <p>        Finally  I could not endure the hot in the tent and came out; I could not sleep until  business was closed at 2AM.</p>
          
  <p>I didn’t  get enough sleep; it was hard to sleep and kept turning my body. </p>
  <p>Keeping  imagination if I sleep under the bridge might be much cooler than here and no  flies. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was determined to be a  scientist to invent medicament to eliminate flies.</p>
