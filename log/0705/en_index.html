  <p class="style5">Sleeping like a baby</p>
  <p align="center">I  woke up at dawn. I didn’t sleep well. </p>
  <p align="center">I spent the entire night closing my eyes  and volunteering my blood to the mosquito inside my personal tent.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">For  the record, I had more than 40 mosquito bites all over my body. </p>
  <p align="center">I was applying  the mentholatum (we used a lot in Taiwan for little bit of  everything) </p>
  <p align="center">and found myself basically rubbing that all over my two arms.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The experience I encountered yesterday slowed down my  brain function, so it took me a while to reset my priority. </p>
  <p>Bu the sudden tummy  ache reminded me that I also had diarrhea and vomiting symptom too.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090126.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Therefore, the first thing now was to find a  restroom. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">I  was lucky enough to know that god has not abandoned me yet.  </p>
  <p align="center">He gave me a gas station and a quiet space to  clean up my body.</p>
  <p align="center">My  body ached, and tired, and I still had to repack everything. </p>
  <p align="center">I had no energy nor  mood to check if anything, other than my cell phone, was missing.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">I had vomited pretty much everything yesterday, and I  couldn’t make myself to eat anything now. </p>
  <p align="center">The only thing I could take at this  moment, even from a five-star restaurant would be, water. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">Before  I left this city, the only thing I knew I had to do was to get my cell phone  back, </p>
  <p align="center">no matter it was functional or not, no matter it was in good shape or  only debris was left. </p>
  <p align="center">I had got to get  my cell phone back, no matter what it took.   </p>
  <p align="center">I only hope that Ahloze was “normal” after a good night sleep, otherwise  I might have to fight with him to get my phone back.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">The  restaurant was closed at this hour, just as I expected. </p>
  <p align="center">I told the cleaning  lady that I came to pick up my cell phone. </p>
  <p align="center">But she asked me to come back later  when others came in to work.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">Without  much luck, I went to buy myself a bottle of water, </p>
  <p align="center">and I found my body finally  accepted the water without kicking it out right at the moment I gulped it down in  my throat.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I got my sense of humor back, I guess. Because I found  it funny that even at this early hour, </p>
  <p>the store couldn’t give me 30 tengs back  when I handed him a 100 tengs bill.  </p>
  <p>I  was wondering he was going to deal with this situation, and the answer was:</p>
  <p> I  got some chewing gums and a box of matches. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">It  was still early, so I went around the city to see if I could find any  internet.  The answer was of course, N-O.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Back to the restaurant around 8 o’clock and it was  still closed. </p>
  <p>I knocked the door and saw the same lady that I met earlier. </p>
  <p>I  insisted to get my cell phone right then, so unwillingly, </p>
  <p>she brought me to the  back and showed me the phone in the restaurant.   </p>
  <p>I said I needed my own cell phone, which Aloze took it from me last  night. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">She probably  couldn’t figure much of what I was saying, but she did recognize the name,  Aloze. </p>
  <p align="center">So she showed me his room and I found that he was still asleep. </p>
  <p align="center">I asked  the lady,” Do you happen to know he is a crazy nut?”  </p>
  <p align="center">I looked around everywhere between the  restaurant and the backyard.  </p>
  <p align="center">Finally, I  found my cell phone outside of the restaurant, it was scratched, badly, but at  least functional.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I couldn’t wait to leave this city. </p>
  <p>Who cared if I  didn’t get the chance to take a swim here or not? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">At  the border of Barhashi, a waiter waved to invite me for breakfast, and I was  hesitated. </p>
  <p align="center">Yesterday’s experience broke my instinct to trust any human beings,  for a while, I guess. </p>
  <p align="center">However, I repeatedly told myself that I should not ruin  my journey in Kazakhstan  just because of a nut.</p>
  <p align="center"> I was impressed of how friendly Kazaks are. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090132.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center"></p>
  <p align="center">I didn’t  want to change that for that nut, either. So, I stopped and took a look at that  restaurant. </p>
  <p align="center">I told myself that nice people get up early, and I walked over with  courage.</p>
  <p>The owner and his wife were  really nice people. I told them that I could only have some milk tea because of  my stomach. </p>
  <p>The lady still brought me some sliced tomato, cucumber and three  eggs.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090129.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">The  Kazaks are still nice people; yesterday was purely a bad luck day for me.</p>
  <p>This “unlucky” experience also reminded me to behave  myself during the trip. </p>
  <p>Think about it, I always told people that I was from Taiwan, </p>
  <p>which sort of made me an unofficial “Taiwan ambassador”  to the locals here. </p>
  <p>They would also make their judgment about Taiwan people  from my behavior. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">I am  sure if I did something to irritate people I met here, not only they would  loathe, </p>
  <p align="center">they probably would think “All people from Taiwan are the same”, in a  bad way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">The  breakfast was great, and the people in the restaurant were even nicer. </p>
  <p align="center">We  talked about my trip and they offered me a couple of tips for my bike from here  to Almaty, </p>
  <p align="center">which I found out all the information they gave me was not exactly  “right”.  </p>
  <p align="center">They told me that I would have  a great biking experience from here to their capital. </p>
  <p align="center">The road condition would  be fine and there would be many stores and restaurants. </p>
  <p align="center">I was so relived, until  I was on my way again.  All I could see  was just deserted lands here and there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">The  owner gave me a brand new white cap, which he said I needed that for the sun. </p>
  <p align="center">I  pointed to my head to show that I had already had one, </p>
  <p align="center">but he insisted that it  was a gift from a Kazak and it represented the friendship.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">After  filling up my stomach, I felt so much better—physically and mentally. </p>
  <p align="center">Well,  since I had decided to continue biking for today, I knew I had to replenish my  energy source—food. </p>
  <p align="center"> I pointed to my  empty plate and took out my money. The lady told me was 100 tengs, which was  dirt cheap. </p>
  <p align="center">To express my appreciation, I gave her 200 and asked her to keep  the change (by waving my hand). </p>
  <p align="center">I was not rich, but I was very grateful for  their kindness when I needed the most. </p>
  <p align="center">They also let me fill up my water  bottles: one with water, one with hot sweetened black tea.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">Before  I left, I noticed that the wind was not blowing to the usually direction. </p>
  <p align="center">I  pointed at the chimney and coughing at the same time to say the effect of that  air-pollution. </p>
  <p align="center">They all agreed with me by badmouthing those chimneys.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090134.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">Honestly  speaking, I was pretty tired of the scenery in Kazakhstan. </p>
  <p align="center">It seemed like everywhere  is the same: boring.</p>
  <p align="center">All  I could do on the road was listening to the exhausting pipe and guessing how many  tires the car behind me had, </p>
  <p align="center">was that a sedan or a truck, or would that car  yield to me or just pass me by.</p>
  <p align="center">Sometimes  if it didn’t feel right, I would yield to whatever car behind me. </p>
  <p align="center">After all,  there were already too many dead animals on the road, there was no need to  volunteer one more.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">Looking  at those dark clouds, feeling the wind blowing from one side to the other, and  drizzling was just the beginning. </p>
  <p align="center">I thought maybe this light rain could keep me  awake, which was not a terrible idea. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090136.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">There were water puddles everywhere from  the raining yesterday, </p>
  <p align="center">and those trucks ran fast enough to splash the dirty  water all over my Dido and me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090139.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">The  rain was on and off, and I could see the real evil—the dark cloud that occupied  the entire sky, was still waiting for me.</p>
  <p>The deafening thunder marked the entering of the  evil’s territory, </p>
  <p>and the strong wind tried its best to push me to the other  side of the road. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090142.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">The  rain was loud and heavy, sometimes I wondered it was raindrops or hails that  were falling from the sky. </p>
  <p align="center">Anyway, I chose to stop for a while by the drainage  pipe area.</p>
  <p>A couple of times, I thought of camping in places like  this. </p>
  <p>However, when I took a closer look, it was full of dung, which totally  put off this “dream” of mine. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090151.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">The  wind blew sideways, and that is why hiding here worked. See! A frog just jumped  out of nowhere after the rain.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">Finally,  the rain kind of stopped. Or you could say the “evil” was blown away by the  wind, </p>
  <p align="center">therefore, the rain had to move with it.</p>
  <p align="center">Wiped  away the water on Dido, I continued to bike. </p>
  <p align="center">The air was so fresh after the  rain, the temperature was also cooling down to a comfortable level. </p>
  <p align="center">I closed my  eye to breathe the clean air, AND… my face was wet by the truck just passed by.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090153.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">I  only saw one building so far, and I couldn’t figure out what kind of  store/restaurant it was. </p>
  <p align="center">I went closer and found that was empty and deserted.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090141.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Around 3 o’clock, finally a  real restaurant appeared. </p>
  <p>Of course I had no idea what the sign said, so I went  in and asked the daughter of the owner. </p>
  <p>She told me that was her brothers’ names.  </p>
  <p>She has two brothers and both of them worked in another city,</p>
  <p> so she and the  grandma took care of the store now (so it was a restaurant and a store after  all).</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090154.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">The  grandma came out and asked me what she could do for me.</p>
  <p align="center"> I gestured that I  needed something to drink, and she gave me a big bottle of Coke. </p>
  <p align="center">Well, I was  feeling better, some coke should be OK.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090156.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I sat outside drinking my  coke, and the grandma asked me where I was during the heavy rain. </p>
  <p>I replied by  squatting down and covering my head with my arms, and the grandma was laughing  out loud. </p>
  <p>She pointed the wooden platform area and asked if I would like to  take a nap there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">Honestly,  I didn’t have any motivation to ride any longer for today, </p>
  <p align="center">what I really would  like to do was to spend the night here</p>
  <p>The rain filled up the gutter and the wooden platform area  was a bit wet. </p>
  <p>The grandma put a big rug down, and I took out my sleeping bag.  Time for a nap, how nice! </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090157.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I slept from 3 to 8 pm, and  I walked somewhere outside to pee. </p>
  <p>The sunset made my shadow look really long,  especially the legs.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090161.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">There  was a power pole outside of the house, </p>
  <p align="center">and all I could think of now was, how to  “borrow” the electricity for my laptop. </p>
  <p align="center">However, it looked like a rather  complicated apparatus.</p>
  <p align="center"> I shall wait until 9 o’clock, which was the time the  electricity was delivered to every household.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090163.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">They  had two dogs, both are BIG dogs. They were chained outside because they barked  to people.  </p>
  <p align="center">I told them that they should  learn their lesson while being timed out here.</p>
  <p align="center"><br />
    On  the other hand, a cute little kitten was running freely in and out of the  house.</p>
  <p align="center">I  cleaned up my face, cleared up my mind, and started talking to those two  ladies.</p>
  <p align="center">The  daughter’s name was Shartena, 14. This is their restaurant, store and also  their house. </p>
  <p align="center">This place is called “Backdownada”(just a phonetic translation,  couldn’t find the name), </p>
  <p align="center">and their house is the only human house in this town.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The grandma’s name is  “Numina”. I bet she didn’t expect me to take a 5-hour nap when she asked me  this afternoon.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090159.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>She offered me food, and I  thought hot milk tea was my safest bet.  </p>
  <p>However,  as kind and considerate as the grandma was, she brought me rice and burger,  </p>
  <p>with some juicy sauce on top of it, the whole meal was tender and delicious. </p>
  <p>I  finished the whole plate, which meant I was recovering even faster than I  expected.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090172.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">The  old grandma asked if I really wanted to continue to bike, or if I would like to  spend the night. </p>
  <p align="center">I was a bit embarrassed but glad that I was able to camp  outside of this house. </p>
  <p align="center">The kitten was busy inspecting my tent and the packs  while I was setting up the tent.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090165.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Finally, 9 o’clock came,  which meant, electricity came. </p>
  <p>The light brought quite a few customers, so the  daughter and the grandma were very busy taking care of the business. </p>
  <p>I, in the  meant time, was trying my best to charge whatever needed to be charged. </p>
  <p>The  grandma was worried the safety of my packs.   </p>
  <p>Since there would be even more customers-- such as truck drivers, come  in later, </p>
  <p>she suggested me to bring my packs inside of the house to be safe.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090176.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p align="center">I  just realized that my everyday in Kazakhstan was a camping day, </p>
  <p align="center">which  was a challenge to me, both mentally and physically. </p>
  <p align="center">I thought camping was fun  at the beginning.  After a while, I  thought camping was tiresome and “dirty” (no shower possible). </p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">As for now, I  was kind of getting used to it. Give me a roof, give me some light, and I was  happy.</p>
  <p align="center">The  trip in Kazakhstan was not  as easy as that in China,  and this was my 10th day here. </p>
  <p align="center"> I should really try my best to get used to it. Maybe the trip in Russia would be  even worse.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090174.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>For what happened  yesterday, I didn’t do my blog last night, </p>
  <p>because I didn’t want to give out  the words like </p>
  <p>“ Kazakhstan is a place for people who like to see flies  everywhere”, </p>
  <p>or</p>
  <p>“ Kazakhstan is a boring place and all you could see is  deserted space here and there”.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I would prefer to review yesterday when I had  some time later. </p>
  <p>Plus, there was no internet available here anyway, why not  sleep more tonight, so I could get well soon.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">The  grandma asked how my schedule was like tomorrow;I told her that I would leave  around seven. </p>
  <p align="center">She explained that if they were not up yet by the time I was  leaving, I should just knock the door to get my packs.</p>
  <p align="center">After  saying goodnight, I went to my tent to get ready for a good night sleep. I  really like sleeping in the tent.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center">It  was very quite when I got up to pee in the middle of the night. </p>
  <p align="center">The electricity  was gone, so was the noise, including the dogs that barked wildly during the  day.</p>
  <p align="center">Shivering  a bit, I ran back to my warm sleeping bag. I still got a couple of hours to  sleep before it’s dawn again.</p>
