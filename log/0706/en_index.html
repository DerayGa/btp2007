  <p class="style5">Friendship on Wrist</p>
  <p>I was not too sure if Granny and Sartana got up early to cooperate with me. </p>
  <p>I was about to wash up, and my tent was not packed up yet when they got out of bed.</p>
  <p>I greeted granny with “good morning” in Chinese. Woops! </p>
  <p>Perhaps it was too homey and relaxing, I forgot that I was in Kazakhstan.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Breakfast was hot milk tea, hot coffee and bread – simple but tasty.</p>
  <p>Sartana was busy getting a bunch of crackers on the table saying that granny wanted me to carry them on the road.</p>
  <p>I had seen the same crackers in restaurants and also bought some in grocery stores myself. </p>
  <p>They were not cheap. They gave me four bags with different flavors.</p>
  <p>They did not charge me for breakfast and the crackers. </p>
  <p>I quietly tucked a small 200 KZT bill in Sartana’s pocket as her allowance.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090177.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Right before I left, Sartana kept saying “labanmi” “labanmi” to me. </p>
  <p>New word, never heard of it. She pointed her necklace and bracelet. </p>
  <p>Did she mean to exchange souvenirs?</p>
  <p>It reminded me of Kepa where I stayed one night a few days ago. </p>
  <p>Right before I left the next morning, Guyweidian said “souvenir” in English and then gave me his resume.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking at his resume where WORD, EXCEL were listed in the skill set section, so far, </p>
  <p>I had not yet seen any other computer except mine in Kazakhstan. I was puzzled, but accepted it as a souvenir.</p>
  <p>If so, I gave her the amber bracelet I bought in Urumqi.</p>
  <p>However, I did not feel “labanmi” meant exchanging souvenir because when Sartana received the bracelet, </p>
  <p>she ran back to the house and told granny that she said “labanmi” to me but I gave her a bracelet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It could be a good thing that we did not understand each other. </p>
  <p>A misunderstanding might become some nice story.</p>
  <p>Even though I did not understand Kazak, I did not focus on not being able to communicate.  </p>
  <p>When people talked to me, I attentively read their body language, eye contact and tone of voice. </p>
  <p>Usually I could get the gist of it.</p>
  <p>Don’t deny ourselves the communication ability.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sartana ran out of the house and put on a swoosh-brand black wristband on my right hand </p>
  <p>where I used to wear the amber bracelet. She was wearing the amber bracelet on her left hand.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090182.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was not easy to take a picture of granny. It seemed that old people were shy in front of camera. </p>
  <p>Sartana helped me to get granny for me to take a photo.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090183.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Waving goodbye, after riding less than a 100 meters, </p>
  <p>I started wondering why the sun was so bright that it hurt my eyes. </p>
  <p>Didn’t my sun hat do the job any more?</p>
  <p>Then I found out that I forgot my hat, so I returned to granny’s in search of the hat. </p>
  <p>Granny asked me what I was looking for.</p>
  <p>I pointed to my head saying my hat seemed to be left here. As I touched my head, I realized that I was wearing my hat. </p>
  <p>It was very embarrassed to be an idiot in the early morning, saying goodbye again. I was really heading off!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was riding toward the north; therefore the sun was on my right side in the morning and on my left side in the afternoon. </p>
  <p>I had to wear my hat at a different angle with the sun; otherwise it wouldn’t block the sun at all.</p>
  <p>However, having the hat tilted on my head, the wind blew it away from time to time. </p>
  <p>I had to stop and go back to pick up the hat all day long. </p>
  <p>Every time I stopped for my hat, I took a break and drank water. Picking up my hat became taking a break.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It might sound stupid that looking for a “lost” hat on my head. </p>
  <p>Something worse happened in the morning. </p>
  <p>During packing up I could not find my orange raincoat anywhere, even though I went through everything.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The last time I put it on was riding out of Urumqi in heavy rain, </p>
  <p>and the last time I remembered seeing it was the large scale clean out I did at the border town Huoerguosi. </p>
  <p>I was very sure that I saw it then.</p>
  <p>How come it disappeared without a trace after a couple of days of riding?</p>
  <p>I never realized its value until I lost it. When I had the raincoat, I was always too lazy to wear it in the rain.</p>
  <p>From now on, even though I wanted to wear it in heavy rain I had nothing to put on. </p>
  <p>Hopefully I could find a shelter when it rained and won’t have heavy rain during the rest of trip – another 100 days or so.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had fully recovered from the sound and restful sleep from noon to night and night to morning after a good meal at granny’s! </p>
  <p>I had never felt better.</p>
  <p>When hopping on my bike I felt like riding a good 150 km today toward the capital city and seeing if I could arrive a bit early.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The same old scenery along the road day after day that one stretch of road up and down in the stark steppe, </p>
  <p>which I had been used to after a while.</p>
  <p>The landscape did not change much. However, the road surface was getting bad,</p>
  <p> road workers would even paint the white line (road marking) with tar. Some of the tar started melting in the intense sun.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The tar stuck to wheels easily. I had no choice but rode in the middle of the lane to avoid it, </p>
  <p>and gave way to trucks when they came by.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090192.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The road workers must have been bored to death during their work, in addition to painting the road marking with tar, </p>
  <p>they also used tar to draw on the road surface along the road, such as a naked woman</p>
  <p>, a 卍 , strange slogans, funny animals and so on. It was like holding a kids’ art show.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090197.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Passing a few houses along the road, I still had a bottle of Fanta bought at granny’s </p>
  <p>and full bottles of water so I did not stop for shopping.</p>
  <p>A young camel man bravely stopped a container car. Wasn’t it impossible to hitchhike with a camel? </p>
  <p>Or to sell the driver his camel?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090198.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>An interesting road sign which means:</p>
  <p>“If you had a car break down in the middle of nowhere, or any emergency occurs and you need help, </p>
  <p>you shouldn’t worry, an SOS phone can be found 70 km away”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090186.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Only one SOS phone was located in 70 km?</p>
  <p> It would be more efficient and faster to replace the road sign with “God Bless You” or “Amitoufo”.</p>
  <p>[Amitoufo is a Buddhist chanting]</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Near noon time, I opened up the peanut butter sandwich crackers, </p>
  <p>drank up the soda for lunch, and then pushed on in full swing.</p>
  <p>Around 1:00pm, a gas station with restaurant was in sight just as I started feeling a bit tired.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090199.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>For my eyes, the photo was not just a picture that a camera captured, </p>
  <p>but an intermediate way station for life which supplied me and allowed me to continue my journey.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I bought two liters of peach ice tea at the restaurant, quaffing a bit, </p>
  <p>and then suddenly feeling cold in the air-conditioned restaurant.</p>
  <p>Changing from hot outside to cool inside and drinking a cold beverage heartily, my body could not adjust accordingly. </p>
  <p>I walked outside to take a sunbath and feel the warm wind readjust my body temperature.</p>
  <p>I took a long break in the restaurant mainly for recharging and writing up the travel log for the last two days. </p>
  <p>My brain was back in business and able to tell stories sensibly.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090203.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had my lunch with the restaurant staff. I guessed they thought I was an Asian and did not speak Kazak at all, </p>
  <p>so they brought in a plate of food mimicking eating food, and then asked me if I would like to eat?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Really simple and easy body language. If I could bring a plate of food with me, </p>
  <p>I would have no problem traveling around the world.</p>
  <p>Lunch was curry-flavored stew potato with dough, onions, and carrots in it – very tasty. </p>
  <p>Since it was quite salty to my taste I felt like accompanying the dish with rice.</p>
  <p>However, I only got bread to go with it. Accompanied with hot milk tea and cold fruit tea, they made a great meal.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090205.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After filling up and writing, I was ready to go. </p>
  <p>I bumped into a staff member from the body shop next door when coming out of the restaurant. </p>
  <p>After he learned that I was from Taiwan traveling on a bike, he became very excited.</p>
  <p>He asked me to hold a minute since he would fetch something for me. </p>
  <p>I thought to myself “isn’t it time to exchange souvenirs again?” I did not have too much stuff left to exchange.</p>
  <p>He came back real quick with a black long sleeve shirt and a piece of blue chalk </p>
  <p>in his hand and wrote down his name “Misan” on the shirt.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090207.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then he passed me the chalk wanting me to write down my name. </p>
  <p>I did “Deray” and “KZ” on the shirt, “KZ” meant Kazakhstan.</p>
  <p>The shirt with our autographs was done. I thought Misan wanted to keep it as a souvenir. </p>
  <p>It turned out that he wrapped the shirt on my shoulder and used the sleeves to make a knot in front of my chest.</p>
  <p>The shirt was meant for me. </p>
  <p>He wished that I could ride with it along the way and never forgot the friendship from Kazakh </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090209.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The staff of the restaurant gave me two bottles of 5 liter carbonated mineral water taken out from the fridge. </p>
  <p>I would like to pay but they firmly declined my money.</p>
  <p>I was fully loaded, and could take only one bottle of water. </p>
  <p>Then they gave me a paper package which looked like expensive chocolate that I accepted delightfully.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090210.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Most of Kazakhs were very friendly, I was glad that 90% of them I had met were very nice. </p>
  <p>Perhaps the only difficult person was suffering from a mental disorder, he did not want to behave like that.</p>
  <p>At least I got my cell phone back, and nothing was lost. I should have left it behind and moved on.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My bags were getting bigger with Kazakh friendship. </p>
  <p>On the first day in Kazakhstan, I was picked up and taken home to overnight by good-hearted Kazakhs. </p>
  <p>No matter where I camped, nobody drove me away.</p>
  <p>I was able to find a safe place to stay every night and the locals also welcomed me to </p>
  <p>overnight and gave me many gifts including a cap, an autographed shirt, crackers, chocolate and water.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even thought I did not know this country, </p>
  <p>the longer I had been here the more I found out that arid </p>
  <p>and barren landscape did not make the people cold and detached. </p>
  <p>The long distance between towns and cities make closer bonding between people </p>
  <p>which was totally opposite to the urban area where people were physically closer but mental far apart.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Central Asia/Kazakhstan might not be as flourishing as Europe, </p>
  <p>or as marvelous as China, but they live their lives in their own way.</p>
  <p>I as an outsider always criticized stuff like how old and rundown their houses were, </p>
  <p>or how poor they looked, without understanding their culture that was indeed immature.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Wrapping the black shirt bearing two names from two countries around me, </p>
  <p>something seemed connected and linked by the knot in front of me.</p>
  <p>Finally after being in Kazakhstan for more than ten days, I was able to get rid of my bias to appreciate their culture.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After the restaurant, the thought was lingering on my mind. </p>
  <p>I started to look back everything happened in Kazakhstan, </p>
  <p>taking them from a different angle and starting to have a different point of view.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In China, would a stranger who came to buy beverages be invited to overnight?</p>
  <p>In Europe, would there be shops allowing strangers to camp under their overhang?</p>
  <p>Are there any other people in the world who would be friendly and help others at any time with respect?</p>
  <p>In Kazakhstan, that was what I experienced everyday. </p>
  <p>However, I was always busy with getting rid of flies and overlooked the more important feelings.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had planned to ride a good 150 km today. However, my break in the restaurant was a bit long. </p>
  <p>It was nearly 5:00pm when I left. The cattle were grazing in one line.</p>
  <p>The reason for a long ride was to prove that I had fully recovered. </p>
  <p>However, I was not pressed for time, what was the point of hurrying?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090214.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The road sign said the next city was more than 90 km away. </p>
  <p>It would be overstretch to make it there. On top of it, the satellite map showed the road was leading up to mountains.</p>
  <p>I returned and backtracked to the town where I saw a plain signboard for a restaurant hotel. </p>
  <p>If it was cheap, I would stay there for tonight.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090215.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The price really surprised me. I had the staff key in the number on the calculator </p>
  <p>to ensure that the price was not for one hour but for one night.</p>
  <p>It was only 400 KZT, unbelievable cheap. The hotel located 30 km away from Almaty charged 2500 KZT for one night.</p>
  <p>The cheapest hotel in the capital city Astana charged almost 10,000 KZT. Here, only 400 KZT?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090216.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>An impossible super-low price hotel was like finding treasure. </p>
  <p>Unpacking the bags outside the door and bringing them in batches, I had a room accommodating four to myself. </p>
  <p>The bed was a super soft spring bed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090219.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The hotel looked shabby from outside, even its signboard was just a plain wood board painted with its name. </p>
  <p>However, the facilities were amazingly luxurious!</p>
  <p>The most wanted item, bathroom, had a super deep bath tub and a steam spa. </p>
  <p>The bathroom was even larger than the hotel restaurant.</p>
  <p>If they had the money to build such good facilities, why didn’t they make the signboard a bit more glamorous?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090222.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Happily taking a hot shower, disinfecting my dirty clothes in hot water,</p>
  <p> I reflected that it was very important to keep my body clean for long term travel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090224.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was a traveler, not a homeless person.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I would have two more weeks in Kazakhstan where once I wanted to leave as quickly as possible. </p>
  <p>From now on, with a new mind, my way and my view would be different. </p>
