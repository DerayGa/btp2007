  <p class="style5">A Secret Hideout</p>
  <p>It rained last night so that everywhere was wet when I woke up in the morning.  </p>
  <p>Even the air was wet, as if the fish can just jump out and swim in the air. </p>
  <p>My breakfast was two cups of coffee, two meat-filled pancakes, and two eggs, thank to the night-shift guys in the hotel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090890.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was ready to bike for today right after finishing the breakfast. </p>
  <p>The wind was much better compared to what I had encountered yesterday. We were having a gentle breeze today.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>About one hour later, I saw a city appeared in the fog. </p>
  <p>I seemed to see a tall building standing there, looked like a well-developed area. </p>
  <p>With the hope of finding the internet, I detoured immediately to search for this city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090898.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>However, when I physically arrived there, I found the “tall building” was just a regular factory; </p>
  <p>the whole city was just another regular city I had seen in Kazakhstan. Well, just a short detour, no big deal. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090900.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Wait a minute. What was wrong with me? </p>
  <p>I detoured to this city because I THOUGHT there was internet available here, </p>
  <p>and I left because I THOUGHT this city was no difference from other cities, </p>
  <p>which had no internet anyway.  </p>
  <p>I needed to do some research to proof my THOUGHT was a reasonable or an unreasonable one.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I looked for the answer, with my “mouth”, to ask around. </p>
  <p>I asked a truck driver if there was any internet available around this area, and I was ready to go as soon as he told me “No”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090902.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But, I heard a “YES”, which was a real surprise to me. </p>
  <p>He pointed the building that was kind right in front of me. </p>
  <p>Suspiciously, I walked over to that building, which actually looked like some office building with a chain on the door. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090903.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then I walked to the back of the building, and found a door, without a chain on it. </p>
  <p>I opened the door and asked if I could use the internet.</p>
  <p>A friendly guy went to get another guy to connect my laptop to a phone-line.  </p>
  <p>Sure enough, I started enjoying the slow, old-fashioned dial-up internet world.  </p>
  <p>He left to do his own work after everything was settled, and he did not ask me to pay for it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090906.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was on the net for about an hour, and the ladies in the office invited me to have a “tea party” with them. </p>
  <p>Savory snacks—cookies, hams, cakes, with hot black tea one after another. </p>
  <p>This would be my lunch, I thought.  Food, internet, friendly people. I really had a good time here, thank you all so much.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090908.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090910.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There was a super critical fork that I had to remember to turn left, so that I would be on the way to Kostanay. </p>
  <p>I certainly didn’t want to get lost in/to nowhere.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090916.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After making the right turn (which was a left turn), I entered a couldn’t-be-worst road. It said, “Under Construction”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090917.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>“This road was actually not meant for any vehicles but tanks”, I told myself while biking on it, and I had ten km to go.</p>
  <p>The road was horrible, and the muddy puddles were everywhere, thanked to the rain last night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090918.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> I couldn’t walk with my Dido, since it was even more difficult to walk. </p>
  <p>So I biked slowly and took every mud that the cars splashed on me</p>
  <p> (I didn’t want to fell in the mud by changing my direction to avoid the splash).  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090919.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090922.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It took me an hour and a half to finish this 10 km.</p>
  <p>Under normal circumstances, I would say this was the worst road I had ever biked on. </p>
  <p>But after the 10-km I just experienced, I was actually appreciated this one I was biking now.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090925.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As soon as I left the terrible construction area, a restaurant was standing right there to welcome me. </p>
  <p>This was the best location ever for a restaurant.  </p>
  <p>Every car finally finished the worst-ever ride stopped for a drink or some food. </p>
  <p>I almost couldn’t get myself into it.</p>
  <p>I laid down all my packs on a car, and started to clean the mud on Dido with my fingers. </p>
  <p>But most of the mud on the tires and the mud guards had to be washed away with water, </p>
  <p>so I brought Dido to the puddles to “clean” the mud away.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090932.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I lost a water bottle, during the muddy ride, I thought. </p>
  <p>That meant that I would have 700 cc less of water for the road, “got to find another one”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090930.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I cleaned up my stuff and finished the potato bread. Guess it was time to go.</p>
  <p>I hoped the construction section was over; I had really low expectation at this moment. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090936.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Well, my wish was not grated. Just a few minutes later, </p>
  <p>the “Under Construction” sign came up again, and the same terrible road condition came up again. </p>
  <p>What worried me was not just the muddy road, but also the spokes on Dido’s wheels. </p>
  <p>Every time I bumped on this extremely uneven road made me skip a heartbeat.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090920.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Struggling riding in the mud, I was feeling really frustrated and angry. </p>
  <p>Then the construction workers saw me and waved me over.</p>
  <p>I didn’t want to go at the beginning since I was so pissed by their “construction”. </p>
  <p>But I was such a polite person, I waved back.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090941.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The next thing I knew, I was invited to ride on the fresh asphalt road they just finished. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090943.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was still bit sticky and soft, but it was better than muddy. I thanked them and got on the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090945.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Interestingly, there was a car ahead kind of waiting for me, he also waved me over, and this time, I received MONEY. </p>
  <p>Although I tried very hard to explain that I had enough money, </p>
  <p>he insisted that I took it and used it to treat myself some nice lunch. </p>
  <p>I didn’t want to be rude, so here I was: 500 tengs rich.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090948.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I spent so much time struggling on the muddy road, which significantly delayed my progress. </p>
  <p>Therefore, change of plan for today. Instead of doing my best to reach the destination, I planned to play by ears. </p>
  <p>I would replenish my food with any chance I had, at gas station, grocery store, restaurant, etc. </p>
  <p>When it became dark, I would just find a place to camp.</p>
  <p>HOWEVER, there was no gas station, no grocery store, and no restaurant. </p>
  <p>So I decided to continue biking as late as I could to avoid staying somewhere too remote at night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090954.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It was almost 9 o’clock when the sun went down, and I still couldn’t find anything. </p>
  <p>The “Under Construction” sign just showed up the third time today, </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090958.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>which really put me off. So I biked into a small town, </p>
  <p>which was built along the railroad, but the train station was nowhere to be found. </p>
  <p>This was a small town, lots of cottages or regular size ranches, </p>
  <p>lots of chickens, sheep, cows, and lots of barking dogs. </p>
  <p>What I really would like to see but really hard to find was “human beings”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090963.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I finally saw some kids and I asked where I could find ANY stores, I meant, ANY stores. </p>
  <p>But the answer was “NONE”. Totally hopeless. </p>
  <p>Well, a man’s got to do what a man’s got to do, which was to find a place to crash for the night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090966.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had two options in front of me in front of me. </p>
  <p>The first one was a spacious deserted house, in which all the windows were broken, and “doorless”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090967.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Another one was a small house nearby the railroad, looked new, and WITH windows.  </p>
  <p>Some one was probably supposed to take care of this house, but that some one was obviously not here today.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090970.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I decided to pick the door number two.  </p>
  <p>However, the door seemed to be locked, so I would just camp outside of this house.</p>
  <p>Just when I changed into my slippers, I found the kids in this town all came here to see me. </p>
  <p>It turned out that the kids in town heard that I came here to spend the night, </p>
  <p>so they also came here-to fill this little house with laughter. </p>
  <p>The whole thing started by a kid named Rustan, he was the leader of this group.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090972.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Rustan had a bike with a “power steering wheel” and “leather seat”, he treated me as his brother, </p>
  <p>regardless of my age or my nationality.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I couldn’t believe this little town can hold so many kids, and it felt so warm to be surrounded by them. T</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090979.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>hey seemed cute and nice, so I shared my snacks in my backpack with them: </p>
  <p>strawberry cakes, chocolate beans, crackers, chocolate sticks and fruit candy.</p>
  <p>These kids were so well-behaved, they didn’t fight for food like I expected. Instead, </p>
  <p>they waited for me to bring the snacks to them one by one, and they did say “thank you”. </p>
  <p>I gave out almost all of my “food”, except the pork sausage, </p>
  <p>which I was not sure if they were allowed to eat pork, and a bag of peanuts, which tasted awful. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So far, I still had my two pieces of chewing gum for dinner, which was not a problem for me. </p>
  <p>I was really happy to see the smiles on those faces, totally worth it.</p>
  <p>To me, it was very easy to get those snacks on the road, as long as I had some money. </p>
  <p>But I thought that maybe for kids in this little town that had no stores at all, these snacks might be hard to get, </p>
  <p>and I was sure they would cherish this little surprise, and that was my best reward.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This little house was also a secret hideout for older kids, to smoke cigarettes. </p>
  <p>I asked if they had dinner already, they told me that smoking of course was important than dinner. </p>
  <p>Then they showed me the key to this little house and opened the door.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090975.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I pointed inside and wondered if I could sleep there tonight. I got 100% “aye” votes so I moved in.</p>
  <p>Looking at those kids, who were looking at me,</p>
  <p> I felt so touched-- thank god I was not surrounded at by “Jiang Shi </p>
  <p>(also called Chinese vampire, which was reanimated corpses that hop around).</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090982.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Some kids went home to bring me a bucket of water to wash my face and to drink. </p>
  <p>Some kids went home to bring me a big glass of hot tea.  </p>
  <p>Some kids pulled my sleeve to invite me to stay at their house for tonight, </p>
  <p>I joked that their parents might kill me if their kids brought a stranger home like this.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Thanks for these kind kids; I had water to clean up myself. </p>
  <p>These little kids filled up this little house, they were very curious about the photos I took during this trip.  </p>
  <p>I asked them what cities they wanted to see first: China, or some big city in Kazakhstan.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And guess what? They wanted to see the photos of their own town. </p>
  <p>It was very interesting that the same town that you could easily see from the window, </p>
  <p>surprisingly made these kids so excited when they see it on my laptop. </p>
  <p>As if the town looked very different from their own eyes and on the photos.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After seeing the photos of this town, they finally felt interested in seeing photos that I took at those big cities of Kazakhstan, </p>
  <p>which they probably would never visit in their life.</p>
  <p>Then they asked to see China, and their eyes were all lit up experiencing the foreign country from the photos.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Suddenly, somebody shouted, “Grownups are here!” </p>
  <p>which for some reason, made me nervous and wondered if I should run with them. </p>
  <p>But, wait a minute! I AM a grownup too, and where could I run?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, it was actually a false alarm, no need to worry.</p>
  <p>It was past midnight; finally some kids started yawning and said that they had to go home to sleep.  </p>
  <p>FINALLY!  I was barely awake myself, but I didn’t want to just ask those kids out so I could sleep. </p>
  <p>After they left, I made my “bed” with sleeping pad and tent, and I went to sleep.</p>
  <p>Sigh. How I wish that I could really call it a night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090993.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>3:30 A.M. The door was opened and a beam of light woke me up.</p>
  <p>This time, the grownup WAS here.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A drunk guy at his mid 30s, short and skinny, asked me what was I doing here. </p>
  <p>I tried my best to explain that I only needed to crash here for one night, he insisted me leaving immediately anyway.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One thing was clear here: it was very difficult to communicate with a drunk person.</p>
  <p> However, he was not TOO drunk for sure, since he suggested me, with his hand gesture, to pay him some cash to stay.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Not that I didn’t have money, but I didn’t want to give him any. </p>
  <p>He took out a cigarette and tried to look for the light, which I guessed that he lost it somewhere when he got drunk. </p>
  <p>So I gave him the matches that the convenient store gave me for lack of changes. </p>
  <p>Unbelievably, this little matchbox softened his attitude to me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As I was packing everything and ready to leave this house, he patted my shoulder and said, </p>
  <p>“Ignore what I just said, you can sleep here tonight.”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1090999.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Wow! For real? I could sleep here for tonight? </p>
  <p>I was still wondering how real this was, that guy lighted up his cigarette and left the house.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It really made me nervous when “grownup” comes, but every grownup was a kid once, right?</p>
