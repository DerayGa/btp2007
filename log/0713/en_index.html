  <p class="style5">Soaking Wet</p>
  <p>It has been cloudy or raining these days. </p>
  <p>Sometime it was drizzling, and sometime I got soaking wet in the rain.</p>
  <p>Back to back rainy days depressed me.</p>
  <p>When I woke up this morning, the sky was terribly overcast. </p>
  <p>If my raincoat was still with me, I would put it on before the rain started, </p>
  <p>because a heavy rainstorm could burst out the next second.</p>
  <p>Without knowing where my raincoat was, I had better ride out of the cloudy area as far and fast as I could.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100010.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Before I set out, Rustan came on a bike to see me off. </p>
  <p>He escorted me riding to the fork road outside the town and said good bye to me</p>
  <p>The rain started since then and never stopped the entire day.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100012.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Here the road was under construction with a detour sign. </p>
  <p>When I rode here yesterday, I got frustrated enough to stop. However I still had to start from here today.</p>
  <p>I did not want to get on the temporary road, following the tire tracks in the dirt, and riding on the road still under construction.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100014.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The condition of the road under construction was much better than the temporary road. </p>
  <p>However it did not last long, the road under construction was then too bad to ride on. </p>
  <p>I had to go back to the temporary road and suffer.</p>
  <p>The milestone, lying down by the side of the road due to the road construction, made me sigh.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100034.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After 12 km I rode into a larger city with the shops I needed. </p>
  <p>My first stop was a grocery store for stocking up on snacks and water since I had run out of food.</p>
  <p>Everything in the shop was labeled with pink price tags. </p>
  <p>At the cashier, the total was shown on the cash register, no communication problem, and certainly no way to bargain.</p>
  <p>I got a bottle of water and a big bag of chocolate cookies for 100 KZT which could supply me for the whole day.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100021.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The signboards along the street were all low key and in letters, which made me see them but not understand them. </p>
  <p>Spotting a signboard with a red cross on it, my instinct told me that it was a pharmacy.</p>
  <p>If it was a pharmacy, I would look for eye drops. </p>
  <p>Long time biking in wind and dust made my eyes sore and tired, so eye drops were consumed quickly.</p>
  <p>Taking a closer look of the sign, it was not only a red cross, there was a snake coiling around a wine glass in the middle of it.</p>
  <p>Very strange icon, couldn’t it be a bar?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100022.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> It was indeed a pharmacy when I went in to check it out, but no eye drops for sale, sigh!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I found a place for lunch, two sunny-side up eggs, two sausages, a cup of milk tea and bread. </p>
  <p>That was a perfect meal.</p>
  <p>After filling up my stomach, stocking up on snacks and plenty of water, off I went in high spirits!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100024.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Right after I got out of the restaurant, the rain dampened my spirits again. It seemed heavier.</p>
  <p>Outside the city, the main road was dug out terribly again. </p>
  <p>I thought the road would lead me straight to the border, </p>
  <p>but now I had to ask the vehicles passing by to ensure that I was on the right road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100030.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After a three hours of dumb riding I was getting wetter in the rain. </p>
  <p>The air was very humid, so the wind could not dry my clothes. On the contrary, it made my clothes damp and cold. </p>
  <p>Soon I was soaking wet. </p>
  <p>The reason why I was still on the road was there was no shelter in sight along the road under construction.</p>
  <p>I found no place for a break, but continued on in the rain. Finally a village was in view, </p>
  <p>I immediately pulled into the town seeking shelter from the rain.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100041.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The dirt road leading to the village became slippery and muddy after the rain. I was about to fall.</p>
  <p>It was too dangerous to ride. I walked Dido to the village. </p>
  <p>There was a tall radar tower which could be seen from outside of the village and a few cement buildings, </p>
  <p>all the others were wooden houses.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100044.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I planed to take shelter in the cement building, walking Dido over and opened up the blue iron gate. </p>
  <p>The cement building was not small, but it did not have eaves or any place that I could hide from rain.</p>
  <p>There was only an overhang above the entrance door, the width of Dido. I hurried Dido and myself to the entrance.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100048.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even though I was not exposed to the rain directly outside the building, </p>
  <p>however, it was still really cold since the wind kept on blowing and throwing the rain at me.</p>
  <p>Knocking on the iron double door, nobody responded, I thought the rain overpowered my knock. </p>
  <p>After knocking harder, still nobody answered the door. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100050.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had been hiding here since 4:00pm, wishing somebody would come to work,</p>
  <p> open the door and let me in to shelter from the rain. </p>
  <p>Better yet, taking me in for one night – please don’t throw me out.</p>
  <p>I thought I would get drier when sheltering from rain, but it had no effect on the result.</p>
  <p>Even if I was in dry clothes, the moist air would also dampen my clothes while standing here.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Squatting down by Dido in this tiny place, I looked down and saw a spider had started making its web on Dido’s wheel spoke. </p>
  <p>The web scene really reflected the dreary atmosphere quite well.</p>
  <p>There could be another spider out of my sight making a web on my body. </p>
  <p>Who knows when the rain was going to stop? </p>
  <p>After two hours of waiting, finally a man walked toward me in rain coat and rain boots.</p>
  <p>Seeing me dispirited, squatting in front of the door, there was no need for me to explain what I was doing here. </p>
  <p>Before saying anything, I was taken into the building sheltering me from the rain.</p>
  <p>This man, Victor, was the building manager for this radar tower.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100052.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The first question Victor asked was “are you hungry?”</p>
  <p>Bingo, I was suffering from hunger and cold. </p>
  <p>Victor called his friend named Victor as well living in the village to bring over some food.</p>
  <p>10 minutes later, a man in rain boots with an umbrella brought me something simple, </p>
  <p>cold goat-innards stew, bread and raw eggs.</p>
  <p>Except for the raw eggs that I did not know how to eat, I finished up the bread and stew without being picky about the food.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100064.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The cold food did not fuel me up, I felt like hot food. According to the current situation, it wouldn’t be easy to get hot food. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Victor took out a large world map (Kazak version) pointing Hainandao, and asked “Is Taiwan here”</p>
  <p>That was an exact question for me. Correcting Victor where Taiwan was on the map, </p>
  <p>I used the map to show both Victors my bike route.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100070.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After filling up, I asked Victor if there were shops in the village.</p>
  <p>Luckily, even though the small village had no restaurants, it still had a shop. </p>
  <p>I followed the Victor who brought me food to the shop.</p>
  <p>Walking on muddy road in my blue-white rubber sandals, I grew taller and taller because of the build-up of mud on the sole.</p>
  <p>Later on I felt like I was walking on stilts and had to wash the mud off in a puddle.</p>
  <p>I pitied myself before seeing three chickens walking in the rain like me and burst out laughing. </p>
  <p>They literally looked like three drowned chickens.</p>
  <p>[Note: “to look like a drowned rat” in Chinese is “to look like a drowned chicken”]</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I bought apple juice, soda pop, raisin cake and white chocolate in the shop, </p>
  <p>and walked back to the radar tower myself in the rain to show Victor my booty.</p>
  <p>We opened up the juice, eating the cake accompanied by the juice. </p>
  <p>This place was not luxurious, but it could shelter me from the cold wind and the wet weather – I desired no more.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100065.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If I had fuel on hand, I would have ignited the camping gas stove and boiled some water to make hot brown sugar water.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After we were full, Victor told me to spend the night here and not to ride in such weather.</p>
  <p>I was thinking to take a break, and when the rain stopped or started to slacken a bit, I would hit the road. </p>
  <p>However, after being invited to stay overnight, I opened up all my damp bags for ventilation. </p>
  <p>Without doing so, they would be messed up.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1100068.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I camped inside the factory building by night, hoping it would be a nice and clear day the next day when I woke up, </p>
  <p>and would never ever complain again about fierce sun or hot weather – I really meant it.</p>
