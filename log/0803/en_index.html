  <p class="style5">Excellent Leg Strength</p>
  <p>I woke up with a headache. It was a mild cold caused by the combination </p>
  <p>of the cold night temperature and the moisture trapped inside the tent. </p>
  <p>I should be able to recover after sunbathing.</p>
  <p><br />
    The positive way to see it was there was no need to pack my sleeping bag after getting out of bed. </p>
  <p>The lazy plan made me feel relaxed.</p>
  <p>I felt like sponge cleaning my face before I set off, however only juice and brown sugar water were in my bottles. </p>
  <p>Those were not good for face washing.</p>
  <p>I used the damp towel which I had already used to clean my body yesterday to roughly wipe my face, </p>
  <p>then my washing routine in the morning was done – </p>
  <p>kids who do not like washing and brushing their teeth after getting out of bed can follow me!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had a choice to make after I left the campsite under the bridge. </p>
  <p>Should I return to the rest area where I passed by yesterday and look for a restaurant to eat and get washed at, </p>
  <p>or should I continue on till the next rest area showed up?</p>
  <p>I picked out the later simply because I had to ride uphill if I went back, which upset me just by thinking about it. </p>
  <p>If I moved on, the road sign said the next city was 49 km away.</p>
  <p>The road sign showed the position of the next city not the next rest area, that was for reference. </p>
  <p>I had nothing to say if I would be out of luck and could not wash up till noon.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120193.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As expected, about 7 km down the road, I spotted a rest area with many trucks parking along the road. </p>
  <p>The signboards for car repair and car wash were all over.</p>
  <p>There was only one brick structure with no signboard but decorated with holiday lights. I guessed it must be a restaurant.</p>
  <p>This was what I saw after getting in:</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120194.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>What did you see? It was a sink, right?</p>
  <p> I saw a sink too! This sink was invaluable to me – free and priceless</p>
  <p>Taking advantage of fewer customers visiting the restaurant, I took a sponge bath with a towel. </p>
  <p>I had been just doing sponge baths these days which were comfortable and convenient compared to a shower</p>
  <p>My shirt, which was wet with sweat, was water-washed as well. </p>
  <p>Shirt, bandanas and towel were line-dried on the rope which was used to hold the entrance door open. </p>
  <p>They should dry up after a meal.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120197.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The store with no signboard was really a restaurant where I heartily ate some hot food.</p>
  <p>Some customer ordered a plate of yummy-looking food. I followed and ordered the same thing as well. </p>
  <p>At the cashier, I found the price was unusually cheap.</p>
  <p>Meat was not cheap in Russia, a steak was usually more than 50 RUB, </p>
  <p>and a grilled kebab was about 150 RUB, which was an upscale price.</p>
  <p>I had got the hang of food ordering: starting with a main dish, such as BBQ or chicken drum sticks, </p>
  <p>followed by side dishes, such as mashed potato or pasta, salad, bread, coffee and desert. That made a meal.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120201.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Today, I had a large steak, smooth mouth feeling mashed potato, a hard-boiled egg with pea salad, </p>
  <p>a large coffee and five pieces of bread. The total was only 68 RUB, about half the price of other restaurants.</p>
  <p>After the first bite of the meat I realized why it was so cheap, it was not beef steak but something like beef liver.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I always used lots of seasoning with my food, such as black pepper or salt, </p>
  <p>since I sweated a lot when biking, and the only chance to replenish sodium was eating at a restaurant.</p>
  <p>After eating and writing up my travel log, it was close to noon when I left the restaurant. Even though I got up early every day, </p>
  <p>it was always close to noon when I started biking – time flies.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All of sudden, more fruit and vegetable stalls appeared along the roadside since farm houses were by the road. </p>
  <p>Every family had apple trees in their yard; they could start a business just with a chair and buckets of apples in front of their homes.</p>
  <p>In addition to apples, a variety of fruit and vegetables were also for sale. </p>
  <p>I stopped and thought what to buy for snacks on the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120204.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A granny saw me and gave me a friendly greeting. </p>
  <p>She asked where I was heading for and then bagged me three cucumbers and four apples. </p>
  <p>When I was paying, the granny said they were gift – free of charge, if I needed more I could have more.</p>
  <p>What a good-hearted granny. What she picked out for me were all good-looking apples. The cumbers also looked yummy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120207.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120211.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When I picked up a cucumber to eat, the granny stopped me and took the whole bag back because they needed washing first. </p>
  <p>Then she carefully washed them for me in a bucket of water. </p>
  <p>I took a big bite of the cucumber, crispy and sweet, juicy and thirst quenching. It was a blessing to receive such wonderful gifts.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120217.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Eating cucumbers reminded me of the old days, like opening up a window to a memory. </p>
  <p>As a child, I ate raw cucumbers as snacks, but did not do it after growing up.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fruits and vegetables were inexpensive in China, </p>
  <p>meat is relatively cheap in Kazakhstan, and both are expensive in Russia except for wheat products.</p>
  <p>What satisfied me most was the price of bread, cookies and cakes, </p>
  <p>and they became the food that I purchased the most frequently.</p>
  <p>The harvested wheat fields became dry and brown. Where were the wheat straws shipped to? </p>
  <p>Without the hay bales in the fields, the enormous land looked differently.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120242.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then it was a whole day bike ride. Please allow me to fast forward and skip past a rather boring ride.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120219.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>At 6:00pm, I went to a shop with a sink and washed up again. </p>
  <p>It was all uphill along the way, so my clothes were dripping with sweat again.</p>
  <p>The sink was outside. I washed my face and wiped my body with a towel. </p>
  <p>If I could find a place like here to clean up a couple of times every day, there was no need to stay in a hotel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120244.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The washed clothes were hung over a rod for drying and were billowing in the strong wind. Half an hour later, </p>
  <p>they were almost dry. It was quite cool to ride in still damp clothes.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120246.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I bought a soda in the shop, sat by the door watching the high wind, and ate the bread I bought yesterday for dinner.</p>
  <p>(Please do not ask me to represent a product while seeing me drinking the product. I do not have that kind of charisma)</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120248.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After rinsing my empty beverage bottles, I filled them up with tap water, </p>
  <p>and then I would have water to drink at night or to wash up if camping.</p>
  <p>It was very important to wash water bottles. They used to be filled with water, </p>
  <p>but now they were filled with a variety of beverages. </p>
  <p>If I did not thoroughly clean them out after every use, the water would taste weird.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The bread went well with the water. When I was eating, a young man walked toward me - a backpacker.</p>
  <p>He carried a backpack which looked quite heavy and wore a cap. </p>
  <p>Sweat dripped from his face. He was all wet with sweat like I was.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120249.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Bumping into such an interesting person, I wanted to chat with him. </p>
  <p>It was alright that we did not speak the same language, I could make conversation – the Russian version atlas, </p>
  <p>a pen and a piece of paper would do the trick.</p>
  <p>His name is Marty, 20 years old, a Russian doing an unbelievable journey– crossing Russia by foot.</p>
  <p>The trip from west to east is about 3,500 km estimated by Marty. He set out on 6/15/2007, today was his day 50.</p>
  <p>According to the distance he had completed and the days he had spent, he did travel on foot, and did not hitchhike at all.</p>
  <p>His backpack was exceptionally heavy. I tried it out and would say it was between 25 kg and 30 kg. </p>
  <p>He stayed wherever he had reached and camped everyday.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120250.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The reason I decided to travel by bike was not only it was eco-friendly, but also it was rather easy.</p>
  <p>If it was not necessary, most of the bags were packed on Dido. </p>
  <p>The travel speed on bike is also 4 to 5 times faster than on foot and biking is relatively less difficult.</p>
  <p>I could only tour in a city on foot for half a day, then my legs started feeling tired,</p>
  <p> and I regretted not touring on Dido to make it easier.</p>
  <p>I respected Marty’s heroic deed, crossing Russia on foot, </p>
  <p>with all my heart. He was young and thin, but he did not look pampered at all.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You go Marty, I admire you. </p>
  <p>No matter how long your journey would be, I believed you would make it to your destination one day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After finishing up the bread and the soda, I hit the road again when the sky became heavy cloudy. </p>
  <p>It was very likely to rain again. I’d better ride out of the mountain area as soon as possible.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120256.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This section of road was newly paved, and the left over gravel and asphalt were all over. </p>
  <p>When cars went by, it was not water or dust that sprayed out from them but the bullet like asphalt.</p>
  <p>I caught the “attack” on my legs one after another – it hurt big time!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120259.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Stuff like that could break windshields, my legs must have quite a few bruises.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A unusual traffic jam occurred. The traffic was heavy in the direction leading out of town. </p>
  <p>It was like everybody was fleeing away from the city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120264.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As expected, as approaching the city the roadways were getting complicated. </p>
  <p>I just wanted to ride along M7 but it was inevitable that I had to ride into the complicated roadway network.</p>
  <p>The roundabout ahead could lead off in all directions. Which one would lead into Moscow? </p>
  <p>I had been following the road sign pointing to Moscow. All of sudden, it disappeared.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120269.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Perhaps every direction led to Moscow eventually, so there was no need to sign it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I chose to ride toward north.I got into the city around 9:00pm and felt a bit troubled. </p>
  <p>If it was possible, I always liked to enter cities in daytime, wandering around and then getting out of the cities, </p>
  <p>and then slept in the suburbs where public safety was better and prices were cheaper.</p>
  <p>With that said, I could not help but feel a headache when getting into a city at night.</p>
  <p>I wanted to find a place to sleep before entering the city. Even though some spots were found, they were not good for camping. </p>
  <p>I kept moving toward the city. </p>
  <p>This city had oil fields. Oil pipes, chimneys with flame and black smoke were visible all over the place.</p>
  <p>It was getting dark. Continuing on was not a good idea, </p>
  <p>so I left the main road and pulled into a small town. It was time for bed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120275.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I was 100% sure that it would rain. It was easier to find a place with roof in a city than in a field. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Getting off the main road and getting on a small street, </p>
  <p>I was expecting to discover a place to sleep before it was dark and started to rain.</p>
  <p>Luckily, there was a ruined building seemingly torn halfway down and pretty battered, but the roof was not torn down yet.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120277.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I came and checked its condition, it had what ruins were supposed to have: </p>
  <p>no pavement, dirt floor, battered wall, no window and no door.</p>
  <p>No empty alcohol bottles and not much garbage were in sight. </p>
  <p>That implied this place was not a venue for a drinking party and should be safe for staying overnight.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120280.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The wall could block the wind and it was not spacious, </p>
  <p>so I did not want to unpack my sleeping bag tonight, it was not that cold.</p>
  <p>Unfolding the inflatable mat, setting up my tent, </p>
  <p>I was ready to sleep using the packed sleeping bag as my pillow and thick clothes as my comforter.</p>
  <p>Before getting into bed, I took a sponge bath with a towel and the water in the water bottle. </p>
  <p>I drank half a bottle of water before I wiped my body.</p>
  <p>Today’s situation was better than yesterday’s. At least I was able to clean my body before sleep. </p>
  <p>Despite the camping site being pretty rundown, it was a “house”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1120282.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As predicted, it rained very hard around midnight, and the sound of the rain drops was intimidating. </p>
  <p>The camping site had a roof and was elevated from the ground around it, so I did not worry about flooding.</p>
  <p>What a relief to find a place like here to spend the night. I wondered where Marty spent his night. </p>
  <p>Was he troubled by rain or did he fall asleep by listening to the rain?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I gave Dido a clap before sleep. During one of today’s out of breathe uphill ride, the total distance broke through the 10,000 km barrier. </p>
  <p>Fantastic, Dido buddy, you had excellent leg strength as well.</p>
