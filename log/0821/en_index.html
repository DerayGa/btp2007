  <p class="style5">Already Got In Trouble And You Still Want To Leave? </p>
  <p>Even  though the hotel I stayed in doesn’t have internet like I had wanted, but it  still give me a good night’s sleep.  </p>
  <p>I  slept until morning and was ready to go through customs.  </p>
  <p>This is the last day the visa is good for  Belarus, and the first day entering Europe.   </p>
  <p>The trip started hard and will now get easier since the road condition  will be better in Europe.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However,  I have to make sure I am able to enter Europe  first.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  I checked out of the hotel in the morning, the employee </p>
  <p>on duty is different so  the price she charged me is also different.   </p>
  <p>Yesterday they charged me $32USD, but now this guy on duty is charging  me $90,000 Belarus Money ($45USD).  </p>
  <p>He  asked me if I used the parking lot?  I  said I came here on my bike, so she added fee for parking motorcycle.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So first thing in the morning I was already  fighting for my rights with the hotel employee.   </p>
  <p>Good thing I still have the piece of paper the person wrote down with  the price on it from last night, </p>
  <p>and no charge for bike storage fee  either.  </p>
  <p>When I tried to pay they didn’t  accept USD, </p>
  <p>so I had to exchange $50USD for Belarus currency in the hotel  currency exchange place. </p>
  <p> I had already  planned to use up all the Belarus currency yesterday but now I got a ton on my  hands.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150406.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  leaving the hotel I followed signs riding toward Belarus/Poland border.  </p>
  <p>The crazy map from yesterday really does mean  a big river.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150411.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Turning right after passing the river, go  straight for 2Km  (1.2miles) will be the boarder.  </p>
  <p>Right  before getting to the boarder there is control booth, cars also separates  here. </p>
  <p> I rode over and ask them where I  should go on my bike.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150413.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  person asked me to take out my passport.   I handed my passport over and he started flipping page by page.  </p>
  <p>I thought what is there to look at?  It wasn’t like I came here illegally.  </p>
  <p>Right after the person flipped through my  passport he said, </p>
  <p>“Friend, we have problem, and big problem.” </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150414.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  front 500meter is the border, but I am stopped here and not allowed to go  through.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  person said I only have Russia  visa, but no Belarus visa so  I can’t exit Belarus.  </p>
  <p>He even wonders how I entered Belarus.  Then he started calling his superior.  </p>
  <p>He talked for a while and then laughed  hanging off the phone.  </p>
  <p>I had thought  everything is ok since they had let me entered Belarus, can they stop me from  exiting?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After hanging off the phone he  told me his superior wanted me to go have a visa done, the address is Balabala  Street #12. </p>
  <p> Immediately I was so surprised  and I didn’t know what to say.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>First,  I need to exit, and who gets a visa to exit?   Second, I just rode here from town, and now I have to ride back. </p>
  <p> Even if I need to get a visa, why can’t I do  it here? </p>
  <p>Three, that Balabala Street #12, how would I know where it is? </p>
  <p> I don’t even have a map on me; so telling me  riding back to the town is the same as telling me to die. </p>
  <p> Four, today is the last valid date for my  Russia visa.  </p>
  <p>So if Belarus visa can’t  come down in one day, then I will be staying here illegally.  </p>
  <p>The problem will just get bigger then.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was ready to faint right there, but shouldn’t  worry about getting into trouble as long as I can solve the problem.  </p>
  <p>I took out my notepad and asked that boarder  patrol guy, </p>
  <p>named Sasha, to please write down that Balabala street address on  the notebook and draw me a map as well. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150415.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  map looks like this.  From where I am at  start riding back, </p>
  <p>pass the river, turn left at the light, then right turn  followed by a left turn.  </p>
  <p>I will get to  the visa place like this.  The map looks  very easy, but really following this map I did find Balabala #12.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150446.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The place is inside an alley without a #12  sign, but there are two huge black sign with Russian on it.  </p>
  <p>However, I don’t know Russian, but this  should be the right place.  </p>
  <p>I parked the  bike in the front and then went inside to get my visa.  </p>
  <p>I know better than to expect someone welcome  me in, and saying </p>
  <p>“You are the person at the boarder without a visa and need to  get a visa done.  Follow me, we have  someone helping you.”  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is more  expectation than winning the lottery.  </p>
  <p>So  once I entered I started asking where can I get a visa?  </p>
  <p>The other people who are here said 2nd  floor, which is this white door. </p>
  <p> Right  when I was ready to go in to ask about the visa such as time, money, </p>
  <p>etc, the  person waiting next to the door stopped me.   “Please stay in line.” </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150420.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Right  now is 10:30am, my visa will expire in 13 hours, and I still have to wait like  everyone else.  </p>
  <p>Half an hour later it was  my turn.  </p>
  <p>After entering they used half  English and half Russian to explain to me I need Belarus visa to exit  Belarus.  </p>
  <p>People who apply for visa are  for entering the country, not exiting.  </p>
  <p>But  the visa officer give me this look saying “You in big trouble”, she stood up  and tell me to go with her. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This building  is separated into left and right halves, and right now I am at the right  half. </p>
  <p>All the employees are female aged  moms in casual clothing.  </p>
  <p>She took me to  the left half and the entire employees in there are cops wearing blue  uniforms.  </p>
  <p>I am just here to apply for a  visa, but she took me to see cops, they are so evil.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150441.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  cop with 4 stars pinned on his shoulder asked me what I was doing after  flipping through my passport?  </p>
  <p>I quietly  said I am a bike rider.  Then he got madder  and madder, </p>
  <p>“How dare you holding Russia visa and entering Belarus?  You don’t know this is illegal? </p>
  <p> I can now arrest you and let you go sit in  jail.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even  though I wanted to explain when I entered Belarus  from Russia  I didn’t get stopped.  </p>
  <p>Besides, when I  met cops in Minsk, the capital city in Belarus,</p>
  <p>the cop didn’t say anything  either after looking at my passport.  </p>
  <p>But  this is hard to explain in both English and Russian.  </p>
  <p>Besides, Mr. Hou said don’t argue too much  with the local cops.  Regardless how  reasonable you are,</p>
  <p> the local cops don’t want to hear.  So I just stood straight and listen to  him.  </p>
  <p>For people who had been in the  military before (Taiwan requires male military service once into adulthood),  </p>
  <p>this isn’t difficult.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  the cop mentioned he is considering arresting me, all I thought about was could  I be together with my bike?  </p>
  <p>Otherwise if  the bike is alone then it will be gone for sure.  </p>
  <p>By the time I get out of the jail I will  never see him again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While  listening at the same time I wondered how long will I be in jail for?  </p>
  <p>3 days or 1 month?  Will someone get me out?  </p>
  <p>Will I get on Taiwan’s news?  How nice will my fellow jail mates? </p>
  <p> And I even thought about how will the jail  food tastes?  </p>
  <p>I have seen movies of  breaking out jail before, would I be able to do the same?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  being yelled at for 10 minutes, the cop saw I didn’t have any reaction.  </p>
  <p>No arguing or explaining from me, just  standing there being yelled at, </p>
  <p>I seemed like I am thinking about my  faults.  He sighed and shook his head,  and told me to follow him.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So  he is finally arresting me, will he give me black and white stripped jail  clothing for my picture? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Following  the cops getting to another door, inside the door is not jail but a beautiful  female cop.  </p>
  <p>The male cop told her, “Help  this guy from Taiwan who is asking for trouble to get a visa.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Right  then I sighed with relief, he wasn’t taking me to jail but help me get out of Belarus.  </p>
  <p>I immediately bowed with thanks to the male cop;  the cop waved his hand and says no need to thank.  </p>
  <p>However, if I dare to do it again, he will  put me to jail.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  he left I sat down on the chair, it really scared me.  </p>
  <p>It was just a visa; I had thought I only  needed to get one, but then the problem get bigger and bigger.  </p>
  <p>Sitting on the chair looking at the female  cop she informed me I need money to get the visa.  </p>
  <p>Right there I understood what it means “anything  that can be solved with money is ok.”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150427.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The visa price isn’t cheap at all.  To avoid pocketing the money, they do not  accept cash.  </p>
  <p>The female cop wrote something  on a piece of paper for me.  </p>
  <p>I don’t need  to look at it to know what it is.  On it  listed 3 prices, $62,000, $62,000, and $10,000 Belarus monies.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150428.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  female cop told me to take this paper to transfer money.  </p>
  <p>I had wanted to take the notebook to ask her  to draw me a map, where can I go to find a bank to make transfer?  </p>
  <p>Besides the piece of paper didn’t write an  account number and such, could the bank deal with this? </p>
  <p> I took all these questions with me; let’s  leave this place first.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The instant I  left the door I immediately thought “I want to run away!” </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  was almost arrested, and now I finally got to get out, why shouldn’t I  run?  </p>
  <p>The fugitive path to take is to  ride back to Russia in 8 days.  </p>
  <p>If I  hurry a little I might be able to do it in 6 days.  </p>
  <p>Then I can go to Taiwan business office in  Russia to extend my Russia visa. </p>
  <p> After  that I can ride through St. Petersburg through north Europe.  </p>
  <p>But I need to do all this before my Russia  visa expires.  </p>
  <p>However, if cop stops me  while riding back to Russia, I will be in so big trouble.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150430.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Can’t  run away, can’t run away, can’t run away. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  need to follow the rules and get a Belarus visa to exit.  </p>
  <p>Without a map I looked for a bank sign all  over the street.  </p>
  <p>Even though it is hard  to find Internet café, but banks are easier to find with a sharp eye.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150432.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  entering this bank, </p>
  <p>I showed the note I got from the female cop to the bank  employee by sticking it on the glass window, </p>
  <p>immediately I felt like I am  robbing the bank.  The banker looked at  it and said they can’t process this type of transaction.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150433.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  a bank this big and I can’t make a transaction?   I can’t believe it.  </p>
  <p>However, it  took me sometime to find this place, how can I just leave?  </p>
  <p>The note I got list money in Belarus  currency, and I don’t have $130,000 on me, </p>
  <p>so I exchanged more money with  $100USD.  </p>
  <p>I took $200,000 Belarus money  with me trying to find a place I can make this type of transaction.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150437.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is the second bank I found, it is much smaller than the first one I found.  There is just one window for transaction  here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150435.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So I followed everyone in line.  When it got to me I passed the note  over.  </p>
  <p>The big bank I found previously  couldn’t make this type of transaction so I wasn’t expecting much with this  one.  </p>
  <p>The banker looked at the note and  then at me, “where is the money to do this?”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150436.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is great!  This tiny bank can actually  process this type of transaction. </p>
  <p> So I  immediately took out $150,000Belarus money and ask the banker to help me.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Three minutes later when I got my transaction  receipt, I couldn’t believe my luck. </p>
  <p> Good thing I didn’t start riding back to Moscow, or I would be crying  the whole way back.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150438.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  is about 11:30am then, almost noon.  </p>
  <p>My  Russia visa is only valid for another 12 hours.   </p>
  <p>In logical reasoning I expect to get my Belarus visa soon and exit  Belarus today. </p>
  <p> However, I better not think  of logic right now, I should think of how can I use my problem solving skills.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150440.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Taking  my receipt I went back to the visa place. </p>
  <p> I walked to the female cop’s door and knocked.  </p>
  <p>She is more surprised than I am seeing me  returning with the receipt.  </p>
  <p>After  checking to make sure my receipt is valid, now is just waiting.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150448.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>She  asked me to sit on the chair to wait, but not going home and then come back in  a few days, </p>
  <p>so I was guessing I should be able to get it today.  </p>
  <p>The wait was over an hour. </p>
  <p> I couldn’t sit quietly on the chair, every  three minutes I went downstairs to check on the bike to see if it is still  there.  </p>
  <p>Most of the time the bike was ok,  but sometimes I see kids being interested in the bike.  </p>
  <p>If they dare to kick the bike over, I will  beat them up.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150444.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While I was waiting I looked at some forms  used for the visa, this one is used for entering Russia.  </p>
  <p>They take the A portion away when I enter  while B portion is on me.  </p>
  <p>They will take  back the B portion when I leave.  </p>
  <p>This  form clearly states this is used for Russia and Belarus, and I only dared to  enter Belarus because I saw this form. </p>
  <p> And now they tell me I can’t exit Belarus without a visa?  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150451.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  always felt time is longer while waiting; I kept checking on the bike and  waiting for the visa on the 2nd floor.  </p>
  <p>After an hour there is good news, after  signing some forms, I got my Belarus visa.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150454.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  passport is now worth more value with this rare visa.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  corner clearly states $50USD but I made $130,000 Belarus money ($70USD) at the bank  earlier.  </p>
  <p>I just pretend it is for  emergency transaction fee.  </p>
  <p>There are no  other words to express my happiness after getting this visa. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The female cop explained this is temporary visa;  valid start today, total 3 days. </p>
  <p> Does  this mean I can have 3 more days on the border?</p>
  <p>Who  would want to stay here?  I took my hot  off the press visa and try to exit Belarus again.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, there is something I need to  do.  </p>
  <p>When I checked out the hotel this  morning and when I exchanged </p>
  <p>money for the visa I ended up getting some Belarus  money on me.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now I have more and more  Belarus money, I need to figure out a way to spend it all.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150457.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  store next to the bus stop.  I had  planned to purchase lots of chocolates, </p>
  <p>but I don’t know who was fighting chocolates  with me.  </p>
  <p>After asking all 5 stores they  all said they were out.  </p>
  <p>Finally, I got  to one store that is selling chocolates.   I purchased 5 packs.  </p>
  <p>In one  breath I spent $10,000 Belarus money ($5.38USD).</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150459.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  had purchased lots of cakes yesterday, now I need to figure out a way to pack  those chocolates, </p>
  <p>and then try to exit Belarus again. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150462.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  3 hours I returned, the boarder control guard Sasha saw me, </p>
  <p>he stopped what he  was doing and asked if I got my visa, </p>
  <p>“yes, your map helped me a lot, thank you  very much.” </p>
  <p> I really wanted to take a  picture of Sasha, but he said he couldn’t be in photos while in duty.  </p>
  <p>So sadly there is no photo of Sasha, using  words to describe he looks like Louie from the Mario Brothers cartoon. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At  the store next to the border, it also has chocolates.  </p>
  <p>The store clerk asked me how many I want, I  said all of it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So  total I purchased 9 sticks of chocolates and 3 bottles of soda.  </p>
  <p>I took one bottle of soda back to Sasha, one  I drink with my lunch, and taking one bottle with me.  </p>
  <p>After purchasing all this I also ate lunch  here.  I ordered fried chicken with  fries.  </p>
  <p>Of course there is also soup,  salad, coffee, and bread.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150469.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even  though I purchased so many things plus lunch, I only spent $27,000 Belarus money  ($14.5USD).  </p>
  <p>Why is spending money so  difficult?  I still have at least  $60,000 Belarus money ($32.3USD) on me, </p>
  <p>how  should I spend it? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> There is no way to  spend it, and no reason to keep it either. </p>
  <p> Then I accidentally discovered there are also currency exchange place  here. </p>
  <p> So I took the $100 Belarus money  to exchange for USD.  With $60,000  Belarus money I only got back $30USD. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150467.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Better than nothing, with USD at least it  isn’t worthless.  </p>
  <p>All the Belarus money  left is all coins, I can’t use them to purchase anything, and so I will save  them as mementos.  </p>
  <p>After lunch is time  for exiting Belarus, it is about 1pm right now.   I took my Belarus visa trying to exit here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150476.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The line is very long.  When I met French traveler Inaki, he said it  is hard to exit Belarus since bikes are not allowed. </p>
  <p> I will have to find a car to exit.  Inaki took 2 hours to enter Belarus.  </p>
  <p>Inaki is French, carrying French  passport. </p>
  <p> Even though France is under  the same European Nation and it took Inaki 2 hours to enter Belarus, then what  should I do?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150477.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So  I rode to the very front riding my bike, the immigration officer stopped me  saying bike are not allowed.  </p>
  <p>Cars and  motorcycles are all allowed, but bicycles and pedestrians are not allowed.  </p>
  <p>I did not see any bus here for me to ride  either.  </p>
  <p>When I was worrying what I  should do the immigration officer told me to stop.  </p>
  <p>He then stopped a van getting ready to go  through and asked the driver to take me on.   </p>
  <p>This is a nice immigration officer.   So I took the luggage off and put the bike in the back, started to exit  Belarus. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150479.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  drivers here are two Belarusian, one is older white haired name Anice, and the  younger one is named Mulin.  </p>
  <p>Being able  to ride in their van is my luck.  </p>
  <p>But  when they heard I rode all the way from Beijing to here, </p>
  <p>light shine in their  eyes, they felt it was their honor to take me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150484.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The customs is the same as before, one side at  Poland and one side at Belarus.  </p>
  <p>However, there is one difference.  At the same place there is customs for both  Belarus and Poland together.  </p>
  <p>Originally,  one would need to get out of the car at place A to do exit procedure, go back  to the car again, </p>
  <p>and then get out of the car again to do entrance procedure at  Place B, and go back into the car again to enter Place B.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here just one stops takes care of both exit  and entrance procedures, </p>
  <p>no need to stop for second time.  </p>
  <p>Taking my passport and exiting the van, there  are lots of cars here the place is totally packed.  </p>
  <p>It took forever just waiting to get a stamp  on my passport.  </p>
  <p>Anice and Mulin travels  between these two countries lots of times, they do not need visa just a stamp  on their passport.  </p>
  <p>One passport can have  10-20 stamps, and they have already gone through one passport and are using the  2nd passport.  </p>
  <p>I wanted to ask  them what do they do traveling between these two countries?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150490.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Regardless, it is easy for them to enter  and exit between Belarus and Poland.   </p>
  <p>However, taking me along is taking them longer to exit Belarus.  </p>
  <p>When I was exiting Belarus the immigration  officer looked at it for 30 minutes, </p>
  <p>he even used black light to check to see  if this is a fake passport.  </p>
  <p>He took  forever to look at it, this is a passport not some famous novel.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150491.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then  it is time to check the cars.  </p>
  <p>Even  though it was daylight, they still used flashlight to check the inside of the  car, and then asked me what is in the luggage. </p>
  <p> I then said in Chinese “it is heroin, cocaine, and these types of stuff,  no big of deal.”  </p>
  <p>Of course they didn’t  understand me, and then I opened up my luggage to let them check. </p>
  <p> I had felt the whole thing was stupid, but  dumber thing is later. </p>
  <p> The same customs  here is used to exit Belarus immigration, </p>
  <p>and then drive 10 meter ahead will  proceed with Poland entrance procedure. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150494.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It only took Anice and Mulin 30 seconds to  get a stamp on their passport, but I got checked over an hour. </p>
  <p> I couldn’t believe it took so much for me to  enter Poland.  </p>
  <p>One immigration officer  speaking English took a form and said to me, </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>“We have some questions for you.”  Then there are the questions: </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Howe much money are you  taking to enter Poland?  </p>
  <p>$500USD.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>Is there a place to stay in Poland?  </p>
  <p>No.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>How you plan to spend the night in  Poland? </p>
  <p> I will find a hotel then.  (Never say camping.)  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If something happened to  you in Poland whom should we contact? </p>
  <p> I  took out my insurance form and on there is emergency contact phone number on  there. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Do you have the paperwork you used to apply  for visa?  </p>
  <p>So I took out the paperwork I  got from Taiwan that said I am crossing </p>
  <p>Euro-Asia on my bike and asking for  assistance when possible.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The person looked at the  paperwork and asked that on the paperwork it said I had planned to go through  Ukraine, </p>
  <p>then how come I biked through Belarus?   </p>
  <p>I said Ukraine visa is expensive and takes a long time to do </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then will you change your route path in the  future?  </p>
  <p>How is that your business, but I  said probably not.     </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Do you have someone you know in Poland?</p>
  <p>I took out Goose’s address  and Poland ID copy.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>Are you from Taiwan or China?</p>
  <p>Wow, so I flipped to the  front of my passport which said “Republic of China, Taiwan” to let him figure  it out.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So  they asked questions like this for an hour, Anice and Mulin smoked a pack of cigarettes  outside and I still can’t enter Poland.   </p>
  <p>Finally, I got through customs, and got my stamp on my passport.  </p>
  <p>Thank god for help, hopefully when I exit  Poland I won’t meet the same treatment.   </p>
  <p>So at the Belarus immigration boarder control we completed both exiting  Belarus and entering Poland procedure.   </p>
  <p>Now just going straight into Poland with no need to stop.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150495.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  had lots of changes left in my bag such as $5, $2, $1 Belarus money, </p>
  <p>there is  no reason for me to keep them so I gave them to Anice and Mulin as thank you  gift for taking me.  </p>
  <p>I felt bad having  them waiting for me for so long. </p>
  <p>After  entering Poland we stopped at the parking lot of this store, so now just on my  own.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150500.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A  group photo before we all leave, on the right is Mulin, in the middle is Anice,</p>
  <p> and the left is me that wanted to shoot myself after so many trouble trying to  enter Poland. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150499.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Taking  out all the bags from the van that hasn’t put back on the bike yet.  So many bags,</p>
  <p> thank bike for carrying all  this during this trip.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So now starting  my first day in Poland at 3:30pm after trying to fix the visa problem this  morning, </p>
  <p>and trying to go through customs/immigration around noontime.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150505.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  yellow sign says Objazd in English alphabets.   </p>
  <p>The strange Russian language is not seen anymore.  There is a sign that says Warsaw, so I will  follow that.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150509.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Same  as what I predicted, the road that runs from Belarus to Poland is this E30  freeway and also called Red #2.  </p>
  <p>So I  just need to follow this. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150512.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  road condition in Poland is excellent, it is all flat and no holes. </p>
  <p> But this also means lots of road are under  reconstruction, so it is common to see a stretch of road under construction,  </p>
  <p>usually a road is cut into sections for reconstruction. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150513.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  is no one here to direct traffic, just traffic lights to control the  traffic.  </p>
  <p>If you don’t want to wait you  can walk the bike in the middle reconstruction area.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150531.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  finally found a sign saying 190km  (118 miles) to Warsaw, the capital.  </p>
  <p>I do  not want to go through Warsaw, but from the looks of the map I will have to  find other ways to get go around Warsaw.   </p>
  <p>It is about 483km  (300miles) from Poznana, which is the other big city in Poland, where Goose  lives. </p>
  <p> Including today I plan to use 4  days to get to Poznana to find Goose.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150515.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are lots of gas stations, stores, hotels, and towns along the way; it is not  deserted at all.  </p>
  <p>It is easy to see there  are lots of places to get supplies along the way. </p>
  <p> But I do not have any Polish money on me  (Zit), and I don’t plan to stay in any hotel the next three nights.  </p>
  <p>So I only need to camp for 3 nights, and then  I will arrive at Goose’s all dirty.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150518.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Lots  of planes in the parking lot, it can be compared to the restaurant that had  lots of army tanks in front of it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150520.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  am on Red #2 freeway right now.  The  whole length of this freeway is approximately 600km (373miles) </p>
  <p>with the final end point in  Germany.  It would take about 5-6 days to  ride to Germany.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150526.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After entering Poland, the hotel sign is  now the easy to understand sign that says “HOTEL”, </p>
  <p>but gas station store signs  are now “SKLEP”, not the easy to understand Russian I was used to.  </p>
  <p>So now when I see “SKLEP” I know where I can  get beverage and food.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150527.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Going  inside to purchase some cold soda, I asked the clerk if they accept USD, the  clerk said yes.  </p>
  <p>So I took out the $30USD  on me, the clerk used 1USD=2.2Zit (Polish currency) exchange value, </p>
  <p>so I only  got $66Zit Polish money.  This is  horrible exchange rate, normally 1USD=2.7Zit.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One  2liter soda is about $7Zit.  Just few  hours ago one bottle cost $3000Belarus money ($1.61USD), </p>
  <p>and now just $7 is  really cheap, except it is Zit, Polish money. </p>
  <p> I didn’t calculate the exchange rate until after I had opened the bottle  and drank the soda.  </p>
  <p>1Zit=15NT=0.50USD  (Taiwan Currency), so $7Zit soda is about $100NT ($3USD). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The same soda only cost half as much in Russia.  </p>
  <p>The cost of living has risen up another fold,  time for living thrifty again although</p>
  <p> I don’t know if there is chance to go  eat in a restaurant again,</p>
  <p> one time not having to worry about the price on the  menu.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Bus  station in Poland,  it looks a lot like a jail.  </p>
  <p>And to think  I almost got arrested today, it is good thing I didn’t fight back to get  arrested. </p>
  <p> This bus station looks fancy,  the ones after this all look cheap, no bench plus lots of graffiti on the  walls, </p>
  <p>some even don’t have any roof covering.   I don’t know if there is a chance to sleep in a bus stop here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150528.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  yellow cross on the street is very interesting, it means the yellow line is  drawn wrong; </p>
  <p>the next one is the correct one.   </p>
  <p>On the street you can see the yellow crossed out sign everywhere, </p>
  <p>so  this road is probably just got paved again. </p>
  <p> So even though the road was just paved and the line was drawn incorrectly,  </p>
  <p>they didn’t even try to mark the cross off, Polish people is pretty  interesting.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150544.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  started riding at 3:30pm and it got dark around 9pm. </p>
  <p> I didn’t eat anything around this time; just  drink 2 liter worth of water.  </p>
  <p>My stomach  wasn’t hungry either, so I just ate some cookies for energy.  </p>
  <p>This is because I want to get to Poznana on  Friday, so I must ride at least 100km  (62 miles) today.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150546.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I wanted to ride some more before sun down  so I did not stop to eat dinner.  </p>
  <p>It is  very common to see bikes in Poland.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After getting into farm country, it is common to see bikes as the main  traveling tool.  </p>
  <p>Looking at this bright  sky, will it rain today? </p>
  <p> I am not sure  with my own weather guessing skill. </p>
  <p> I confidently  said which day it will rain, but I am not sure which day it will not rain.  </p>
  <p>Even though there aren’t a lot of clouds in  the sky, but the air is very humid.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150548.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  don’t want to bet too high so I must find a place to sleep for the night.  When I was riding by I saw this empty house. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150550.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  exterior is ok, some windows broken is fine since this is not our house.  </p>
  <p>I took the bike to the front to examine the  area a bit. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150563.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  ad on the front of the house makes it look like the house is for sale. </p>
  <p> Whoever purchases this house can open it for 24-hour  rest stop. </p>
  <p> I go inside to look, it is  amazingly clean, no wonder it is a house for sale, it has a lot of potential. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150566.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  house is clean, just some places with paint peeling off.  </p>
  <p>As long as there are no empty bottles inside,  then I know this is not a place for homeless people to gather around.  </p>
  <p>Looking outside from the broken windows, I  can still see what is going on, </p>
  <p>and it is much cooler inside, no feeling of  being trapped inside.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150569.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Judging  this house from a broken down empty house, this is worth 4 stars. </p>
  <p> If there is electricity, then it is 5  stars.  So I spent my first night in  Poland here.  </p>
  <p>After cleaning up myself a  bit, I got scared by a bird that flew in from the hole in the ceiling.  </p>
  <p>The bird built a nest underneath the  roof.  Just let me stay here for the  night,</p>
  <p>I won’t bother you, please do not poop on my head during the night. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150572.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  this great house I actually didn’t sleep the whole night. </p>
  <p> I rolled around and couldn’t understand  why. </p>
  <p> I had already gotten into Europe,  and found a comfortable place to sleep.   </p>
  <p>My stomach was growling the whole night, but I shouldn’t be so hungry I  can’t sleep.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The final conclusion is  that because the trip is almost ending, the whole feel is different once  entering Europe;</p>
  <p> I am so excited so I lost sleep.</p>
