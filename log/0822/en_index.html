  <p class="style5">Hard Times</p>
  <p>I have been adjusting the time on the watch  continuously due to time change.  </p>
  <p>But it  seems like the watch got time change problems too since the alarm went off at  5am </p>
  <p>when it should have gone off at 6am.   </p>
  <p>I had hung the watch on the bike, so when I heard the alarm went off I  didn’t know what time it was really.  </p>
  <p>I  felt I had just gone to sleep and now I had to get up again.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sleeping in the tent I could see what is  going on outside,</p>
  <p> the dark sky shows the sun hasn’t came up yet, so I stayed in  bed and will get up in a little bit. </p>
  <p> I  slept for an extra 30 minutes before getting out of the tent.  Looking out of the window, </p>
  <p>I see it is foggy  outside even though it didn’t rain last night.   I am very lucky I didn’t sleep somewhere in the field last night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150577.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Packing my gear up and I said good-bye to  the bird underneath the house.  </p>
  <p>I  stretched a bit before getting ready to ride again.  </p>
  <p>Now taking a look at the watch I realized it  is not 6am yet.  I got up too early  because of the faulty alarm.  </p>
  <p>I had  thought I had slept in a bit, but I still got up early and packed up </p>
  <p>my stuff  as well so now there is no way to go back to sleep.  Let’s go then!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150592.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This empty shack wasn’t covered in fog,  however if I ride a bit then I will enter the white foggy area.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150596.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The light signal shows red, but even if it  shows green I would be afraid to ride in there </p>
  <p>anyway that is because I can’t  see anything in front of me.  </p>
  <p>Carefully I  rode though, the visibility level is very low, and I have to be careful when I  ride.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150598.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am afraid the cars driving that fast will  miss me; if they hit me I am in big trouble.   </p>
  <p>I turned on the red flashing light on the back of the bike to alert  other drivers of my existence.  </p>
  <p>I am not  sure what is the visibility in this fog.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>About 10 minutes later the sun rose up inside the fog, but it seem so  small and insignificant.  </p>
  <p>But in about an  hour all those fog will disappear due to the sun shining on them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150605.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I found electric outlet outside this  restaurant.  </p>
  <p>This time I am smarter, I  took out one thing to test if there is any electricity here, I didn’t take out  everything at once.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150608.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Too  bad there still wasn’t any electricity, so I will ride while the weather is  still nice and cool,</p>
  <p> I will find a restaurant during lunch time to write the  travel journals.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This hotel has price shown outside.  In Europe,  the hotels will show what level of ratings they are using stars, </p>
  <p>this hotel has  no star.  A single room costs $60Zit  ($27USD), which is approximately $900NT.   </p>
  <p>The owner must felt the price is cheap enough so they show it, but it is  still too expensive to me.  </p>
  <p>Even if I  took out all the money I got right now out, it is still not enough for one  night stay. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150615.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>New street sign, a little girl holding a  red balloon, does it mean to be aware of kids?   Its design is really cute.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150616.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once entering Europe  there are more and more churches everywhere. </p>
  <p> At first I think it is so neat so I will keep taking pictures, </p>
  <p>but after  awhile I would get bored and not even take out the camera anymore.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150619.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Solar energy powered traffic signal, even  though Polish people use English alphabets, </p>
  <p>but they are not English at all,  since I cannot understand any of those.   </p>
  <p>That is ok, as long as I can understand location and distance. </p>
  <p> If I get lost on big roads like this, then I  must be too stupid.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150625.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I always see this blue “L” sign on top of  cars on the street; at first I have no idea what it means.  </p>
  <p>When I get bored, I would imagine what this “L”  word means: “L” </p>
  <p>got killed by the night god, then how can it be driving on the  street?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Or does “L” mean it is left  side?  But almost all the cars on the  road are ones with driver on the left, </p>
  <p>and I have never seen a car with sign  that says “R” meaning “Right”.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150627.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After seeing this driving course, then I  realized the “L” means new driver.  </p>
  <p>So  next time when I see “L” sign I need to get away fast since their driving skill  are not that good yet.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding on the Red  #2 freeway I saw this sign early in the morning saying no bike.  </p>
  <p>I have no problem with “no carriage” but what  does it mean “no bike?”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150629.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is annoying after entering Europe, lots of main roads forbids bike on there.  </p>
  <p>But there is no other roads I can take, even  if there are I don’t want to take the long way either. </p>
  <p> Initially I pretend I didn’t see this sign so  I continue to ride.  </p>
  <p>After few 100 meters  there is another sign just like it, now I pretend I didn’t understand it.  </p>
  <p>Then there is another one and I pretend it is  in the wrong spot.  </p>
  <p>The forbidden bike  sign continuously line up on the road, but I just ride along. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I will figure out what to do if I get  stopped.  </p>
  <p>Even though it says bike  forbidden, but there is a huge area marked for the shoulder of the road,</p>
  <p> it  would be too disappointing not to use it. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I wish there are less of this sign; it is very annoying.  </p>
  <p>Around 9am I stopped at a gas station to  purchase some food to eat.  </p>
  <p>I finished  most of the water in the water bottle for my cleaning the night before.  </p>
  <p>Then I drank the last few mouthfuls when I  ate the cake this morning. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150630.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are lots of things here at this gas  station. </p>
  <p> The map that I couldn’t find  before is here, and there are lots of maps here as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150632.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It depends on if you want the map of whole Europe,  or just maps of Warsaw, </p>
  <p>there are lots of selections, each are about $200NT  ($6USD).  </p>
  <p>It takes less than one week to  ride through Poland  so I will save the money in purchasing a map.   </p>
  <p>I will just follow my way from the road signs; I will try to stay away  from the big city to avoid getting lost.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Browsing through the refrigerators, the prices aren’t that cheap.  </p>
  <p>The best price is this juice, 2 liters of  apple juice is cheaper than other juices that are just 1 liter each.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150635.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The price is labeled $4.69Zit ($2USD), I  gave $5Zit to the cashier but he didn’t give me back any change.  </p>
  <p>The smallest coin is $50 cents Zit, so  anything less than that automatically goes into the store’s pocket. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I continue to ride west while drinking the  apple juice, and around 11am I arrived at a gas station area with  restaurant.  </p>
  <p>At this time my stomach was  rumbling, I should eat something warm.   If possible lets bring on lots of food.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150640.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are three trolls displaced in front  of the store.  The store is pretty  comfortable.  </p>
  <p>Before I would clean myself  a bit in the restaurant’s bathroom using a towel, I am using the same way in Poland  too.  </p>
  <p>Besides, it is safe to eat tap  water here in Poland.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150643.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is Polish all over the menu, but I can  still understand some words such </p>
  <p>as burger and hot dog that are the same as  English writings.  </p>
  <p>I ordered one $5Zit  ($2USD) pizza, and took out my electric charge things.  I will probably spend at least 3 hours here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150644.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  made to order pizza will come to the table in a bit.  </p>
  <p>When I was cleaning myself with the towel in  the bathroom I saw a guy playing the slot machine. </p>
  <p> I saw him pretty happy; I guess he probably  won a lot of money here. </p>
  <p> The guy shared  his happiness with me and invited me for a big mug of cold beer</p>
  <p> right after I  finished washing my hair in the restaurant bathroom.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150651.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The beer plus the pizza I ordered for  myself for lunch.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150646.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Sitting  in the restaurant writing the travel journal really takes a long time, </p>
  <p>as I  have to organize everything that happened when I was entering customs in Poland.  </p>
  <p>Around this time when I hear the slot machine  with coins dropping out, </p>
  <p>I know the guy will share his happiness with me by  inviting me to more cold drinks. </p>
  <p> The guy  bought everything in 2 portions, the other portion he always shares with  me.  </p>
  <p>After the cold beer I also got iced  tea and orange juice.  He even asked me  if I am hungry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> He asked me if I am going to Warsaw?   </p>
  <p>No way, if I go into Warsaw  I will get lost.  I am avoiding Warsaw and going toward  Poznana to find my friend.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Around 2pm  when I was getting ready to leave the restaurant,</p>
  <p> the guy gives me a big bottle  of soda to take on the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150652.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had filled both water bottles with water  at the restaurant, </p>
  <p>and my stomach had also been filled with drinks. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> It was hard to drink this soda since my  stomach has already been filled with lots of beverages,</p>
  <p> so I put the soda in my  jacket pocket and continue to ride on. </p>
  <p> It was hard to ride carrying the 2-liter soda next to my chest.  </p>
  <p>Several times the soda fell rolling to the  ground.  I was really worried the soda  bottle would burst.  </p>
  <p>It wasn’t long after  leaving the restaurant I reached a town, here are special bike lanes, I felt  respected.  </p>
  <p>This is totally different  from the signs I saw this morning that forbids bikes to be on it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150660.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There is no safety hazard to bikers here  because even with heavy traffic, this is special bike line.  </p>
  <p>The bike has their own separate path to ride on;  it is the same side as pedestrians.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150662.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Once entering a town I will start looking  for Internet access.  </p>
  <p>However, this is Europe, there is no need to look for Internet store  signs. </p>
  <p> In any street there are wireless Internet  access available.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was very difficult while  carrying the 2-liter bottle of soda and the laptop looking for Internet  access.  </p>
  <p>In one setting I decided to  drink the whole bottle of soda, but now I am worried my stomach will  burst.  </p>
  <p>Now there are fewer things on my  hands, and I also found some wireless Internet.   </p>
  <p>But I couldn’t hook onto the wireless Internet; I am a little  disappointed now.  </p>
  <p>Entering a computer  technology store, the store clerk looked at me holding my laptop, </p>
  <p>did they  discover that I am secretly using their wireless Internet? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I honestly told them I am traveling  through, and all three of them said they could tell.  </p>
  <p>They saw me walking by in front of their  store twice already; </p>
  <p>they are wondering if there is anything they can help me  with.  </p>
  <p>Yes, is there Internet access I  can use?  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150666.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then they took me into the store along with  my bike, since I heard bike theft is really high in Poland.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So during this time I cannot let the bike  leave my sight.  </p>
  <p>Luckily I got hooked  onto the Internet here, so I uploaded all 3-travel journals.  </p>
  <p>This includes the journal I just finished writing  an hour ago.  </p>
  <p>This is the difference  after entering Europe; the Internet speed is  fast enough for me to be grateful. </p>
  <p> At  the same time I also updated Google Earth map, </p>
  <p>I still have no idea what paths  I need to take for the rest of the trip.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150670.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While I was at the store, the store clerk  looked at the online travel journal.   </p>
  <p>They also purchased some beverages for me, and offered some cream buns  with coffee.  </p>
  <p>While spend an hour here I  got stuff to eat and finished what I need to do.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150669.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In front of the store I took a group  picture with everyone, </p>
  <p>everyone is asking why there is no English version of Poland’s  travel journal yet? </p>
  <p> So for people who  are translating, foreign readers are anxiously waiting for the English version  of the travel journals, </p>
  <p>now they are just looking at the photos.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After leaving this town where I found  Internet, </p>
  <p>the sign says in another 30Km  (18.6 miles) on Red #2Freeway will reach Warsaw.  </p>
  <p>But I don’t want to enter Warsaw at all.  </p>
  <p>But they drew the sign so easily, it looks  like once you enter </p>
  <p>Warsaw you can easily leave Warsaw and get on Red #2  freeway again.  </p>
  <p>However, I think once I  enter there is huge chance I will get lost in there.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150679.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  goal is get on Red #50 freeway and go around Warsaw. </p>
  <p> But this road says no bike allowed.   Even though I had ignored the same sign this morning,</p>
  <p> but now I have to  follow what the sign says, no bike here.   </p>
  <p>This is because trucks aren’t allowed on Red #2 freeway so now they are  all taking Red #50.  </p>
  <p>Besides there is no  shoulder to the road, so regardless how many lives I have it isn’t enough to  ride on Red #50.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Unwillingly I rode into Warsaw, it was around 6pm in the  afternoon.  </p>
  <p>I only have a small wish,  which is to let me get out of Warsaw  before it gets dark.  </p>
  <p>I have no other wish  at this moment.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150691.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Initially I still saw signs that point to  the direction to Poznana, so I followed those sign dearly.  </p>
  <p>Unfortunately after I entered the city there  are less and less of those signs, and then it completely disappeared.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150697.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is probably the home of some famous  Polish person; too bad I am not familiar with him so I can’t introduce him.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150701.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since I was just following the sign going  towards Poznana, </p>
  <p>I accidentally got on this freeway connecting bridge that is  used only for automobiles.  </p>
  <p>I got a little  scared, but it is even more dangerous trying to </p>
  <p>get off the bridge by riding  opposite direction, so I had to continue on.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150702.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150704.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After getting off the bridge, I cross to  the other side.  </p>
  <p>The whole Warsaw has special bike  lane all over the city.  </p>
  <p>There is no  place bike riders can’t get to; it is safer to ride here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150709.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>However, I cannot see the signs posted on  the bridge from where I am, here at the bike lane. </p>
  <p> I am not sure if I am riding toward the  correct direction.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150729.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even though there is special bike lane, but  I got on car only path again.  </p>
  <p>All this  is because I was riding the bike and following the signs.  </p>
  <p>So I dangerously got into the city while  riding on car only roads.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150713.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Right next to me is bike and pedestrian  only path, but there is a barrier between, and I can’t get over.  </p>
  <p>So I just ride carefully on the very edge of  the road.  It is a good thing no one here  will honk at me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150720.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The wide river right next to me, three  minutes ago there was just small rain going on so the sky is a bit dark. </p>
  <p> The view is gorgeous, if I can only cross the  barrier and get on the other side.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150721.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are lots of bike riders in Warsaw, just as many bikes  as cars.  </p>
  <p>Other than looking at the signs  I also asked people for directions.   </p>
  <p>Everyone very nicely answered my questions, and the first things they  ask me are “Do you speak English?”</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150734.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Yes, of course I can speak English!  </p>
  <p>Suddenly the language I haven’t used for a  while opened up. </p>
  <p> The European feel  surfaced once again.  It is wonderful to  understand someone and to be able to have a conversation. </p>
  <p> There are two types of cross walks on the  street.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The white is for pedestrian, and  the red is for bikes.  Pedestrian and  bike have their own light signal.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150736.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150740.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The map before I enter Warsaw said that if I ride continuously I would  exit the city and connect to Red #2 Freeway. </p>
  <p> I swear I was riding straight but it changed to Red #7 freeway.  It feels as if I am getting lost.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150741.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On the safe side I continuously ask both  bikers and pedestrians for direction. </p>
  <p> I  was hoping there wouldn’t even have a chance of getting on the wrong road. </p>
  <p> However, since I am in the middle of the city  center, </p>
  <p>even for locals it would be hard for them to explain how to get to  Poznana.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150742.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>With lots of left turn, right turn,  crossing the street, crossing the bridge, taking the under pathway,</p>
  <p> I kept  telling myself don’t feel like I am getting lost.  </p>
  <p>This is because as soon as I feel I am  getting lost, then I must have gotten lost.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150744.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150766.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So now I use my ultimate tool, the  compass.  </p>
  <p>I took out the compass with the  combination of the sun and riding toward the west.  </p>
  <p>Looks like I will have to cross through Warsaw to get to #2Red  now.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150746.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After leaving Red #7 I connected to Red #8  on the west.  </p>
  <p>Even though the color is  right but the number isn’t right. </p>
  <p> But at  least now I am toward west so it shouldn’t be too far off.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150758.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The sun is going down, don’t leave me  behind!  </p>
  <p>I got up earlier than you this  morning and now I am trying to find my way around, how can you leave me  behind.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150762.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The road I ride on changes, now it changed  to Orange #719.  If this isn’t lost, then what does it mean  getting lost?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150764.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even if I am taking the wrong path, but at  least I am sure I am leaving the city.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150770.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Now my expectation is even less, as long as  I can get out of the city, even if not connecting to the right street will be  ok.</p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>I will just figure out a way to get  on the right road again, just let me get out of Warsaw.   </p>
  <p>The sky is getting dark, and there is no sign of the sun but the sky  still has some lights to it. </p>
  <p> But this is  the last hour to the light in the sky; even the street lamps are lighted  up.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even though I have gotten lost since  the first day in Beijing,  but I never thought it was a big deal getting lost, </p>
  <p>I figure there will be a  time finding the right road.  </p>
  <p>But at the  time when I was lost I couldn’t calm myself, why does the city have such  complicated street design.  </p>
  <p>I really miss  the comfort of riding on the countryside with just one road going straight  ahead.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150779.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even though I had asked at least 30 people  for direction, </p>
  <p>and I still can’t believe the path I took in crossing Warsaw after I looked at  the GPS map.  </p>
  <p>However, by miracle I still  road out of Warsaw,  it was around 9pm.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/warsaw.jpg" width="900" height="455" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150784.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because the sun already went down so I am  now wearing my normal glasses.  </p>
  <p>From the  time I entered Warsaw  it took 3 hours to get out of it. </p>
  <p> I didn’t  browse around happily; all I did was spending a lot of time trying to find a  way to get out of it. </p>
  <p> Smoothly I got out  of Warsaw, and  I even connected to Red #2 freeway, </p>
  <p>it is the miracle inside a miracle.  Right now I am less than 300km (187miles) from Poznana, </p>
  <p> I should have no problem getting there in 2  days.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150788.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After getting out of the city, I need to  find a resting place.  </p>
  <p>Even though I have  left Warsaw,  but there are still as many people here on the street. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> It wasn’t like the moment I got out of Warsaw it became farm  fields.  </p>
  <p>Around 10:30pm, I found this  factory but the gates weren’t closed up. </p>
  <p> It is very obvious they are closed for the day.  I just need a corner to spend the night. </p>
  <p> I am pretty sure it will rain tonight, so I  need somewhere there is a roof covering.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150790.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Pulling the bike into the factory area,  even with all the doors closed I didn’t dare going inside. </p>
  <p> There is a small porch area, so I plan to  lean against it for the night. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150791.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Unloaded the bags from the bike, washing my  face and changing into my pajama, </p>
  <p>even if today end like this for me is still  fine.  </p>
  <p>A car entered the factory area, I  didn’t feel right in my heart.  </p>
  <p>But since  I had unloaded the bags, there is nowhere I can hide.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I honestly stood underneath the porch area  waiting for the car to drive by.  </p>
  <p>The  shiny car headlights shone on me.  The  driver stopped the car and asked me what I was doing here.  </p>
  <p>It doesn’t matter if I say I am just passing  through with my bike, the driver didn’t sound nice.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Rather than saying asking me to leave, he was  asking me to get out immediately.  </p>
  <p>So I  put all the bags onto the bike again, and I had to change back into my riding  clothing. </p>
  <p> I had thought today was going  to end like this with me sleeping on the porch area, but it wasn’t so simple. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> With the driver’s eyes watching me leaving  the porch, I rode into the night.  </p>
  <p>Since  I can’t stay here for the night, I will have to continue to ride on.  </p>
  <p>The second place I found was another factory  like area.  </p>
  <p>Again this one doesn’t have  the gates pulled up either, and there doesn’t seem to be anyone in. </p>
  <p> On the edge of the wall there is some roof  covering sticking out, it will work sort like a roof covering.  </p>
  <p>Putting the bike against the wall, I unloaded  the 3 back bags to lessen its weight. </p>
  <p> This time I am not going to change into my pajama since I don’t know  when I will get kicked out again.  </p>
  <p>So I  wore whatever was on me and leaned against the wall to sleep.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150796.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  didn’t take out the sleeping bag, tent, or the air mattress. </p>
  <p> I am still wearing my slippers because when I  was getting kicked out earlier</p>
  <p> I didn’t get a chance to put on my socks and  shoes. </p>
  <p> I leaned against the wall with my  eyes closed. </p>
  <p> Even if I don’t’ fall  asleep I still need to get my energy back since I still need to ride  tomorrow. </p>
  <p> Around midnight someone  approached me so I opened my eyes again.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This time was an old security guard.   He shone his flashlight at me asking me what I was doing here.  </p>
  <p>Again, I said I am traveling through with my bike;  can I stay here over night?  </p>
  <p>I will leave  as soon as light is out, I won’t cause you any trouble.  </p>
  <p>The old man didn’t say anything and then  left. </p>
  <p> I thought he agreed to let me stay  here for the night, and felt it is easier to communicate with old people.  </p>
  <p>Right then I pulled out the sleeping bag to  cover myself, but with the dark clouds and thunder, </p>
  <p>I wasn’t sure how good this  roof covering will be if it actually starts raining.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150797.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Five  minutes later a car drove by, this time is a big man and next to him was the  old security guard next to him.  </p>
  <p>So when  the old security guard left he went to find someone to get rid of me.  </p>
  <p>At first I thought it was a cop, but then I  found out it was another security guard.   </p>
  <p>No need to say he was asking me to leave.  So the sleeping bag I just took out now I  need to roll it back up again.  </p>
  <p>But at  least there is no need to change my clothing. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the second time I got kicked out, I was a little sad.  </p>
  <p>Why is it so hard to find a place to  camp?  Is it because this is a big  city?  </p>
  <p>But then rest of the way to Paris is all big  cities.  </p>
  <p>Getting back on the road again,  looking at the sign I figure I might as well ride all night.  </p>
  <p>With the distance I can ride during the day I  can probably ride 300km.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This way I can go find Goose tomorrow. </p>
  <p> Too bad I immediately overruled myself since  it is too dangerous to ride at night.   </p>
  <p>Even if I can ride safely till morning, but will I have enough energy to  ride during the day? </p>
  <p> I continue trying  to find a place I can spend the night.   </p>
  <p>The third place I found was this residence area.  All the buildings line up neatly;</p>
  <p> I picked  one that is toward the inside, and one I felt has less people going in and out. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150801.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even though it was 1am in the morning, but  there shouldn’t be anyone going in and out right?  </p>
  <p>There is also a red roof covering shielding  me from the rain.  </p>
  <p>Surprisingly when I  pulled on the door handle, it wasn’t locked.   </p>
  <p>So I pulled the bike inside, and I sat on the floor by the entrance and  tried to sleep.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150802.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is the third place I tried to spend the night,</p>
  <p> I hope I won’t get kicked out  again but I am still prepared just in case I might be kicked out any time.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I sat up and leaned against the wall to  sleep.  </p>
  <p>Around 3am someone came, she  looked like a college student.  </p>
  <p>When she  opened the door seeing the bike and me parked there it scared her.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>She entered her home and then came out  again.  </p>
  <p>I had thought she was going to  ask me to leave.  </p>
  <p>But no, she asked me if  I needed water or something else?  I thought  for a second but told her no. </p>
  <p> I just  need to stay here for the night since it was raining thunderstorm outside. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I had been kicked out twice, but this time I  felt so warm having someone asking me if I need anything.  </p>
  <p>But I didn’t want to bother anyone, so I  better not ask for much. </p>
  <p> I have to thank  the two people who kicked me out earlier.   </p>
  <p>The moment I arrived at this residential area, rain started  pouring.  </p>
  <p>The howling wind feels no  different to a typhoon. </p>
  <p> If I had stayed  at either of the two previous places, I don’t know how wet I would have been by  now. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150803.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The title of today’s journal is “Hard Times”,  </p>
  <p>it doesn’t mean today is hard time, but it is Polish “thank you”, the sound (in  Mandarin) is “Hard Times”.  </p>
  <p>As soon as I  learned this I started saying this more often to people, always thanking  people. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> In reality this trip isn’t hard,  but lots of “thanks”.  </p>
  <p>While resting  inside listening to the thunderstorm and feeling the nice gesture from that  girl.  </p>
  <p>The city wasn’t cold at all, just  one niceness from one person will be enough to </p>
  <p>overcome 1 million people  telling me to get out of here.  </p>
