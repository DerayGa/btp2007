<p class="style5">遍地明燈</p>

  
<p>After  leaning against the uneven wall all night to sleep, </p>
<p>it felt there were pricks  picking on me.  </p>
<p>Around 2am, I got up and  changed to sleep on the cold floor, </p>
<p>and used the sleeping bag as a pillow. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I slept to around 5am and then got up.  This is because of time difference; </p>
<p>the alarm  clock woke me up an hour early. </p>
<p> At the  same moment, there was an early rising grandmother who walked out of the  apartment. </p>
<p>The grandmother was shocked  to see me sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p>Not  only did she didn’t ask me to leave; </p>
<p>she asks me if I need to go inside and  sleep on the stair steps.  </p>
<p>Thank you but  no need since it was almost light outside, </p>
<p>there is still huge distance I need  to ride today.  For where to sleep  tonight, I will figure it out later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p>Ripping off a page from the notebook I  wrote some thankful words: </p>
<p>Last night I say need nothing, <br />
  Because your smile is everything<br />
  Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stick it by the stair  steps where I slept hoping the nice person will see it.  </p>
<p>After being kicked away several times the  whole night, </p>
<p>I felt the coldness from the people of Warsaw.   But I still met people with a warm heart. </p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150807.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>Barely  light outside, stretch a bit before ready to leave.  </p>
<p>There was no need to repack anything since I  didn’t take out anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There  were barely any cars on the road.  </p>
<p>After  sleeping on the streets a few times, </p>
<p>the least number of cars on the street is  between 3-6am.  </p>
<p>You can even roll around  on the street, although it would better not to do that.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150809.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p>For  the breakfast the last few days, I have been eating the cake I purchased from Belarus.  </p>
<p>Really, each roll of cake lasts me a meal  with the addition of water, soda, and juice. </p>
<p> I will drink whatever beverage I can get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With  the $66Zit I exchanged after getting into Poland, </p>
<p>there wasn’t a lot of money  on me.  </p>
<p>Thinking back, the store that  exchanged my money is a bit of evil.   </p>
<p>They only exchanged me $36USD for $66Zit.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with the worst exchange rate, I should  be able to get $81Zit.  </p>
<p>Since there weren’t  a lot of cash on me, I will have to watch myself.  </p>
<p>My goal is to make it to Poznana with 4 days  of ride with just the money on me.  </p>
<p>There  are lots of ways to save money including going to the grocery stores more, </p>
<p>less  restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150813.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>Like this a huge bottle of soda plus  another huge bottle </p>
<p>of orange juice and 2 loafs of bread just around $11.5Zit,  it is a good deal. </p>
<p> The bread has already  been sliced, and it is easy to eat.  </p>
<p>The  texture is totally different from the ones I have eaten before.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150815.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>First thing is the crust, which is not like  the dry and hardness of normal bread.   </p>
<p>The Polish bread crust is chewy, similar to chewing gum, which requires  a lot of chewing.  </p>
<p>Then the inside, the  white and soft texture is pretty good, but salty. </p>
<p>I am pretty sure they added lots of salt when  making the bread dough to produce this flavor. </p>
<p>Even white bread is this salty, so Polish must prefer heavy taste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p>While  chewing my bread and drinking juice, </p>
<p>I found there is a water faucet outside of  the store.  </p>
<p>Before going to sleep last  night I didn’t even clean myself at all, </p>
<p>not even changing clothing, this is  probably the dirtiest I have been on the whole trip.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150819.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>From the faucet’s flowing water I wiped  myself all over trying to </p>
<p>get rid of the tiredness from yesterday, today is a  new beginning.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150817.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>In Poland,  90% of the people are Catholic so churches are seen everywhere.  </p>
<p>Even in places there are no churches there  are still beautiful carvings </p>
<p>and smaller sized church like burial plots.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150821.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p><img src="photo/P1150844.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p><img src="photo/P1150862.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>There  is one similarity among those burial plots; </p>
<p>they all have this oil gas lamp  underneath.  </p>
<p>There is no exact design to  those lamps, but they are seen everywhere, even at bus stops.  </p>
<p>In the dark nights when there is a lamp  lighted in the field, it makes the night seem warmer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p> I don’t feel good riding today.  </p>
<p>But ever since arriving to Poland, I could  feel the street condition gotten better, </p>
<p>this is the result of road  resurfacing. </p>
<p> It would be difficult  riding for 10km and not  see any street resurfacing, </p>
<p>almost every road are being worked on.  </p>
<p>Or is it my bad luck picking streets that are  always under working condition?</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150826.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>When there is work going on at the left of  the road, everyone will push to the right.   </p>
<p>When there is work going on at the right of the road, everyone will push  to the left.  </p>
<p>Today is very special, the  work is going on at the center of the road, </p>
<p>so everyone are pushing toward each  side of the road, which is where I was riding at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With  the road so small I didn’t expect any car will go around me or let me go first,</p>
<p> this is because the road are so small.   </p>
<p>When the truck passes, there are no spaces left at all.  </p>
<p>With 10km or so of road under service, I have to park the  bike on the </p>
<p>grass at the side to wait until there no heavy traffic going on  before I can ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then  if the traffic gets heavy again, </p>
<p>I will have to park the bike on the grass  again to wait the traffic out.  </p>
<p>It is no  use always waiting, so I figured out a way.   </p>
<p>Since I can’t ride fast anyway, I ended up taking the bike to the center  of the road, </p>
<p>and walk the bike there.   This is faster than just waiting on the side.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150828.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>
<p>All  sorts of fruit trees that doesn’t have any fence surrounding them, </p>
<p>the most  common is apples; each of the apple is huge and red.  </p>
<p>There are also fruits like peaches, grapes, apricots;  I can reach them with just my arm extended.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150832.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p>However, this is considered stealing, if I  want to eat fruit I will wait until I see a fruit stand.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around noon I found a restaurant that is not  very popular because of road construction,</p>
<p> I decided I would rest here today.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150833.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>The menu is covered in Polish, </p>
<p>the ones I  can understand on the menu are fast food but I don’t want to eat them.  </p>
<p>By luck I picked a $5Zit ($2USD) meal, </p>
<p>what  they delivered was a bowl of hot soup with sliced sausages and a huge piece of  bread.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150837.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>Half  of the bowl is covered with delicious sausages; </p>
<p>tastes so good I almost  swallowed my tongue with it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However  just like the bread, the soup is ridiculously salty. </p>
<p>Before I would always put lots of salt and  pepper on my food before starting to eat, </p>
<p>but I don’t need to do that in Poland.  </p>
<p>Now I just take my water bottle and ask them  for water.  </p>
<p>Staying in the restaurant  during the hottest time of the day until about </p>
<p>3pm in the afternoon before I  left.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course during this whole time I  was writing the travel journal. </p>
<p> I also  washed my dirty clothing and dried them under the hot sun outside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p>I  can ride faster, or eat faster, but I can never write travel journal fast.  </p>
<p>If I can finish an entry in about 2 hours I  will clap with happiness, </p>
<p>however normally it takes about 4 hours or so for  each entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p>The  red brick church that I had passed on the street.  </p>
<p>Even though it looks hot outside, but it was  actually pretty cool, </p>
<p>the temperature didn’t go past 30C (86F)  when I ride.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150843.jpg" height="1600" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>This  is not an empty country at all, comparing to China,  Kazakhstan,</p>
<p> Russia, and Belarus, this country seems very  impacted.  </p>
<p>Of course there are fields as  well, but it is impossible to pass more than 10km or 100km  </p>
<p>where there is no homes, stores, gas stations, and hotels are everywhere.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150845.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>When  I felt it is deserted here, immediately I see a McDonald 2km (1.24mile) up ahead.  </p>
<p>If there were enough money, then it would be  hard to be hungry or sleep on the streets in Poland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p>Of  course McDonald is not my stopping point, I continuously riding toward  Poznana.  </p>
<p>I got really lost in Warsaw yesterday, so I  didn’t ride as much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When  I got up this morning, there was still 300km (186mile) from Poznana.  </p>
<p>So today I must ride at least 150km, and leave the other 150km for tomorrow.  </p>
<p>If I want to arrive at Poznana early, then I  must try harder today.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walking into this  store for the last shopping trip today.   </p>
<p>Looking at the prices in the store, after evaluating I picked a bottle  of lemon soda.  </p>
<p>In this store other than  bottled water, this is the cheapest beverage.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150853.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>It is difficult to take such a large bottle  with me, </p>
<p>so I sat in the shade of the store and drinking the not cold  soda.  </p>
<p>I also put water in my water  bottle so I can use it tonight to </p>
<p>brush my teeth along with wiping myself  clean.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right then there is a guy wearing  red and white-checkered shirt seeing </p>
<p>me drinking my soda asked me if I was  hungry.  </p>
<p>And then he asked the cook  inside to make a bowl of tomato soup with noodles. </p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150852.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>Even  though this is simple food, but I feel warm inside eating warm food.  </p>
<p>The sour tomato soup is very tasty, at least  not as salty as the sausage soup I had for lunch.  </p>
<p>I took out the bread I had purchased to eat  with the tomato soup.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what I had  for dinner, thanks to the nice man.   </p>
<p>Right when I was getting ready to leave, the cook gives me a bottle of  water.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150855.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>When  I arrived here I had empty water bottle and hungry stomach, </p>
<p>but when I left I  was completely filled and the water bottles are also filled with water.  </p>
<p>In addition I also have a bottle of water as  a gift and half bottle of lemon soda.  </p>
<p>After  thanking them I continue to ride toward the west, I haven’t reached 150km today, </p>
<p>lets go! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  
<p>Even though the sun hasn’t gone down yet  but it has already been covered with dark clouds, </p>
<p>so the whole sky looks like  it has been bombed.  I bet it will rain  tonight, 90% sure it will.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150859.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>Looking at the sky, I know it will get  darker earlier tonight, </p>
<p>so I will need to find a place with roof covering to  sleep, or in a hotel?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t be joking, I  will reach Poznana tomorrow, why would I stay in a hotel.  </p>
<p>Besides I don’t have the money either,</p>
<p> let’s  keep riding and see if there is any place I can sleep tonight.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150867.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>Good bye, sun, I will go to bed later than  you tonight.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I will  sleep longer, and not get up earlier than you do.  </p>
<p>Before it got dark I found this strange empty  building.  </p>
<p>The exterior is completely  perfect, the windows are not broken either.   </p>
<p>I feel there is no one living there, let’s check it out first.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150872.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>Going around the house there is a little  path leaving to the building, the path is very private, </p>
<p>there are grasses  everywhere and peach tree above my head, </p>
<p>even the entrance is almost covered  up.  It doesn’t look like anyone comes  here.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150874.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>I  discovered it was definitely an empty house after entering, </p>
<p>this is probably a  warehouse or storage, and there are piles of wood and stalks.  </p>
<p>However, there is a flat rectangular shaped  area inside, this is the bed intended for me.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150880.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>After checking out the whole place making  sure this is a campsite, I brought in the bike.   </p>
<p>Taking off the luggage then put the bed on the soft stalks, </p>
<p>so I won’t  get sore from sleeping on the ground.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150893.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>When I was cleaning myself up, it started  raining outside.  </p>
<p>After an hour, it  rained harder, the rain came down heavier and heavier, I felt luck. </p>
<p>Luckily I found a place to sleep, what if I  am still on the road?</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150889.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>Looking out of the window from inside the  building, the entrance is covered with plants. </p>
<p>This feels like one of those cabins on a deserted island.</p>
<p><img src="photo/P1150892.jpg" height="506" width="900" /></p>

  
<p>I slept well; I barely slept at all last  night, and the night before I couldn’t sleep.   </p>
<p>So today once I lay down I slept soundly, and the rain got heavier  during the night. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The rain pouring down,  it felt like ocean waves smacking down with the addition of the thunder. </p>
<p>Both nights are like thunderstorms.  </p>
<p>It is a good thing the rain happened in the nighttime,  </p>
<p>and it would be good to ride the bike during the day.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rain however much during the night, but  please stop raining during the day, </p>
<p>give me back blue sky during the day.</p>
