  <p class="style5">Goose, I am Coming!</p>
  <p>In one breath, I slept three days  worth.  Regardless how loud the rain  sounded, it couldn’t fight my sleepyness. </p>
  <p> I fell deep into sleep, the kind of sleep where you don’t realize where  you are when you wake up.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The rain stopped early in the morning,  although there were still some </p>
  <p>dark clouds covering the sky so it seems like it  might rain again.  </p>
  <p>Goose called this  morning and said it will rain today, </p>
  <p>and all I can wish is it won’t rain  anymore so I can ride safely to Poznana.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even though rain has stopped, but there is  still one annoying thing, the wind is blowing very hard.  </p>
  <p>The wind is blowing in opposite to the  direction I am traveling, so the whole day I rode against the wind.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I kept thinking the earlier I arrive at  Poznana so I can rest comfortably for two days, but it didn’t work that  way.  </p>
  <p>I rode slowly the 150Km (93 miles) to Poznana.  </p>
  <p>I had planned to arrive at Poznana in the  afternoon, however by the time I arrived at Poznana it was close to dark.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150900.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  Red #2 freeway I had been on for half of Poland is now under  reconstruction.  </p>
  <p>They are planning to use  Poznana as the center which connects Berlin on  the left and Warsaw  on the right. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150904.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even though reconstruction isn’t finished  yet and only part of the way is accessible, it cuts down on the traffic  flow.  </p>
  <p>It is safer with fewer cars on the  road.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even if there are lots of cars it is still  ok, Polish people follow rules when driving. </p>
  <p> The crazy drivers seen in Kazakhstan  and Russia  are gone now.  The speed limit here is  half of what it is in Russia.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Traveling over 120 days there are some  things that are broken such as the carriage thing on the front of the  bike. </p>
  <p> When I was at China I found  it was getting loose so I decided to have it weld in permanently.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After shaking on the whole trip from the  unpaved road, two screws still fell out even after being welded in.  </p>
  <p>For one of the holes I used substitute screw  to lock it in, </p>
  <p>but for the other hole the screw the screw grain line has gone  completely flat,</p>
  <p> I can’t even lock it in with another screw anymore.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150911.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There is another matter that troubles me  even more; the supporting bar is about to break.  </p>
  <p>The five big bags each have their own carrier  connecting to the supporting bar.  </p>
  <p>If the  supporting bar breaks, then there is nowhere I can put the 5 bags.  </p>
  <p>In addition, if just one side of the  supporting bar breaks, the weight of the bike will be lop-sided.  </p>
  <p>So if just one side of the supporting bar  breaks, then there is nowhere to put that one side’s bag.  </p>
  <p>Right now I don’t’ know any other way to  carry those bags with me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150913.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This problem happens where the weight is  the heaviest on the back big bag.  </p>
  <p>When I  realized it this morning the supporting bar is separating with the bag.  </p>
  <p>This scared me so much I tried to figure out  how to lessen the weight.  </p>
  <p>Opening the  bag, I took out the easier to carry but the heaviest item as well, the laptop, </p>
  <p>this should lessen the weight on the supporting bar.  But now the problem is where can I put the  laptop?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150909.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Scratching my head for a while, there is no  place to put this, </p>
  <p>so I ended up putting it on top of the bags in the  front.  </p>
  <p>I have to be careful when I ride  the bike just in case if this flies out when I ride, </p>
  <p>then there is no laptop  for me to write the travel journals.了。</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Red #2 freeway ends here, probably  changed to A2 freeway.  </p>
  <p>The rest of the  way I am taking Red #92 freeway.  </p>
  <p>The one  I had been riding, E30, from Belarus  ends here as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150926.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is the reconstruction freeway; there  are 100s of Km from here to Warsaw.  </p>
  <p>The estimated finish time is 2010.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By then the flight from Warsaw  to Berlin  will decrease, the flight will go to Poznana instead.  </p>
  <p>Then Poznana will become a world trade center  and the economy will increase as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150928.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I am hungry now, time to eat, looking for  food in the mini mart along the street.</p>
  <p>There is a fan inside.  During the summer time Poland will  sell out their fans.  </p>
  <p>Today is a good  sunny day, indoor and outdoor both have cool weather.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150929.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Looking around I decided to buy the same  lemon soda I got yesterday.  </p>
  <p>Yesterday I  paid for $5.5Zit ($2USD), and the storeowner also gives me a free bottle of  water.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150932.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Today, the exact same lemon soda is just  $2.5Zit ($1USD)!  </p>
  <p>Even though purchasing  beverages in a restaurant is always higher than in a grocery store, </p>
  <p>but one cannot  stop being suspicious considering the price is doubled at the restaurant! </p>
  <p> In addition, I also purchased 3 ice creams, 2  chocolate and one strawberry. </p>
  <p> I sat in  front of the store finishing my lunch consisted of ice cream and half bottle of  lemon soda.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I also ate the two savory breads I  purchased yesterday.  </p>
  <p>At first, it was  strange eating those, but after awhile I got used to it.  </p>
  <p>Besides, the savory bread also adds to the  salt content I lost in my sweat.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After finishing my ice cream, I purchased  some fruit from the street stands.   </p>
  <p>Yesterday when I saw all those apple trees I just want to eat them.  </p>
  <p>This bald man with shades doesn’t look like a  fruit seller, but he is.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150946.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Picking up 2 apples, the scale is the  traditional scale. </p>
  <p> Putting the two  apples in the holder and use traditional weight to measure.  This is probably used over 100 years ago.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150947.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Two apples one bigger than the other,  grabbing a handful of coins letting the boss pick out what he is charging me,  </p>
  <p>he only picked up $2.15Zit ($0.80USD).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Poland, coins become useful again,  </p>
  <p>hopeful there are chances to pick up loose change on the road again. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After eating my apples, I continue my way  toward Poznana.  </p>
  <p>Because I am riding  against the wind today, the speed is really slow.  </p>
  <p>Thus I won’t stop at lunchtime to write the  travel journals, I will wait until I am at Poznana.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Other than the music I am listing when I  was riding, I also heard this weird blowing sound.  </p>
  <p>I stop the bike and turned off the iPod,  there was a bad feeling inside of me.  </p>
  <p>I  figure I might have blew a tire, but it probably wasn’t as easy as blowing a  tire.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150950.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Luckily there was a bus stop in the front;  too bad the all-clear design couldn’t provide some shade for me.  </p>
  <p>This time the tire blew on the front, which  originally was the originally poor condition back tire that I moved to the  front, </p>
  <p>but this tire blew again anyway.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This time the  tire blew wasn’t because something got stuck, </p>
  <p>but it is from the tire being  rubbed down with the inner tubing blew as well.  </p>
  <p>This is why when I ride on the road the weird  windy sound.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is too bad, the tire is not even worn  yet and the tire already got rubbed to a hole.   </p>
  <p>This is the maximum for this tire, may it rest in piece.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150963.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Looking from the inside out, this is where  the spot got rubbed bare when I changed tire last time.  </p>
  <p>No surprise this is where tire blew again,  light can even pass through the hole.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150960.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I will let Kenda know the maximum limit for  this tire is 12479km (7754  miles),</p>
  <p> if they are planning to come out with even durable tire; I hope I have  the chance to test it.  </p>
  <p>This time I will  have to change the whole tire set.  </p>
  <p>The  tire on the top is the brand new tire with the perfect marking on the tire; the  bottom is the one that just blew.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150970.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This looks similar to the before and after  of someone having a facial.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since I will have to change the tire, I  will change everything including the frame, inner and outer tube.  </p>
  <p>I will use the stronger tire set from Taiwan, in one  look I am not sure how this new set is different from the old one.  </p>
  <p>The completely black frame makes it look  stronger with speed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150973.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This new set of tire has already been  prepared for me, and the inner tube placed inside as well.  </p>
  <p>All I have to do is put air in it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150976.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Ah, this photo shows I ride the bike with  slippers!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When changing tires there is a small thing  I need to remember to remove, that is the speed meter.  </p>
  <p>Without this I wouldn’t know how fast I am  riding and how far I have rode.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Too bad I didn’t have any tools to remove  the speed meter,</p>
  <p> I hit it with my hand several times and finally was able to  remove it.  </p>
  <p>I was really worried I would  accidentally break this.  Even after I  carefully removed this, </p>
  <p>the speed meter still did not install correctly so I  have to use the tape to fix it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Changing both the front and back tires at  the same time, look at how nice it looks now.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150977.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Doesn’t the black tire look cooler?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The gear on the back wheel is brand new  too.  </p>
  <p>The brand new look makes one feel  respectful, although it doesn’t look very useful.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150981.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The old chain after riding 10000km is not clutching to  the new gear, even with lots of oil to grease it,</p>
  <p> the bike still makes this  clicky noise when I ride it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The new wheel frame doesn’t have any broken  wire or frames bending, </p>
  <p>the bike doesn’t have this unbalance-shaking feel.  </p>
  <p>From Kazakhstan  to Poland  I have been shaking on the unbalance bike for several thousand km, </p>
  <p>suddenly  there is no shaking feeling I will have to get used to it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The new clicky noise isn’t just sound, but  the tiny movement feeling passing from the pedal to the feet, </p>
  <p>so the feet gets  this weird deadening feel.  </p>
  <p>We will see  if after riding for a while the chain and the gear mix well a little better.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even after changing the new tires, I can’t  leave the old one here since they were part of the bike.  </p>
  <p>I retie everything on and bike toward Paris.  The bike still got four wheels.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150984.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  addition to the blown out tire, the fibers on the ends of this rope is coming  apart.  </p>
  <p>This reminds me of my shoes, my  lost shoes with the ends of the shoelaces coming apart just like this rope. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150983.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had planned to arrive at the destination  around 4pm, but because it took time to change to the new tires,</p>
  <p> I didn’t stop  to rest, didn’t visit any restaurants, and didn’t bother to write the travel  journals either.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding against the wind is really  troublesome, it is always so slow, and changing to the new tire didn’t speed  this up either. </p>
  <p> I am still getting used  to the clicky feel.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Goose called around 4pm, I said I would  arrive around 6pm.  At 6pm there was  still 40km (25  miles) left,</p>
  <p> so I said I would arrive around 8pm.  The arrival time is continuously moved later.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I rode to the point the GPS was close to  out of juice, the red light kept flashing, and I was still on the road.  </p>
  <p>Normally by this time I would take out the  laptop and put it in sleep mode.  </p>
  <p>I would  connect the USB wire so I can allow the GPS to charge up while I ride.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I couldn’t do that today since the laptop  doesn’t have any juice either.  </p>
  <p>This is  the result of not getting into a restaurant and write the blogs,</p>
  <p> so the electronic  items didn’t have a chance to charge up.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If I am going to continuously ride like  these, then GPS will stop recording the riding trail somewhere in the middle,  </p>
  <p>this doesn’t feel good, I will have to find a place to get things charged up.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The help place is the bathroom inside this  gas station. </p>
  <p> Luckily there is a plug in  there so I charged up in the bathroom for 5 minutes, </p>
  <p>and then I continue riding  toward Goose’s place.  </p>
  <p>So in addition  using bathroom for normal use, I can use it to charge electronic items.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150986.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While waiting for the five minutes, I  washed my face and went to the gas station to buy a bottle of orange  juice.  </p>
  <p>$66Zit for four days shouldn’t be  hard, this is because today is already day 4.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We are already getting into the city center  here, </p>
  <p>but there is no sign on road to Poznana so either they didn’t put a sign  up or I missed it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150991.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Upon entering the city center, all the big  streets connects together, </p>
  <p>the freeway merges with lots of roads starting with  the name A, </p>
  <p>those streets will separate again after exiting Poznana.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I am not afraid entering the city, but  after I enter the city I will have to let Goose know where I am.  </p>
  <p>I kept following the sign going toward the  city center; the busier place the better.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150993.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Poznana is very different from Warsaw even though both  are big cities, but their feel is very different.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150995.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Warsaw was destroyed during World War II, so now it consisted of very new  and elegant buildings.  </p>
  <p>Poznana consisted  of old and traditional buildings, so this town has this ancient elegant feel.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By the time I arrived, it was 8:30pm, the  sky was still bright, </p>
  <p>and the orange sunset color allows me to browse this city  in its most beautiful color.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1150998.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are beautiful carvings and pictures  on the side of the building, </p>
  <p>it is seen everywhere and elegantly done.  The whole city has lots of museums and  churches, </p>
  <p>not only they are free but they are open 24 hours.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160008.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are electronic track cars on the street;  they charge using time, 10 minute per unit.   </p>
  <p>So when you ride them, you will have to figure out how long between each  stop, </p>
  <p>this is a pretty unique style to calculate the riding fee.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160009.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Poland sits between Germany  and Russia, so regardless  who </p>
  <p>fights whom back in the olden days they will travel through Poland, </p>
  <p>and then destroy Poland.  Poland has already been destroyed 4  times.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is pretty sad to hear, one country  being destroyed 4 times, </p>
  <p>but still rebuild themselves.  Besides Polish people takes price in their  own country and themselves.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Poznana there are lots of parks, zoo,  and places to visit.  </p>
  <p>The students here  browsing around the city for a year or two still isn’t enough. </p>
  <p> It is very lucky to come here for school.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160012.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Poznana is a college town; there are four  colleges here.  </p>
  <p>Polish people have high  contribution toward developments in literature, art, and science.  </p>
  <p>People such as Chopin, Madam Curie are all  Polish.  </p>
  <p>This is the old castle used to live  by kings.  </p>
  <p>Polish money is printed with  faces of king, similar to the king you see on cards.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the other side of the castle.  </p>
  <p>Today is Friday night, on Saturdays the stores  are open until 2pm in the afternoon.  </p>
  <p>On  Sundays only the big stories are open, the rest of the stores are closed,  everyone goes to the church for service.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160017.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This castle is only open once a year; I am  not sure what kind of elegance can be seen inside.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160033.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The double cross seen on some square, this  square is made in memory of a poet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is in memory of this poet named “ADAM”,  too bad I am not familiar with this person.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160021.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160024.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Next to the park is this beautiful  building, the pointy building with castle like exterior.  </p>
  <p>This is the religious service building to  some school; there are lots of classical music exhibitions here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160027.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Those photos were taken while waiting for Goose;  </p>
  <p>Goose supplements the words later on.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Just on this street along there are lots of  beautiful scenery, </p>
  <p>Poznana is a city worth staying at for rest for a few days.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160032.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was waiting for Goose at the intersection  of some huge street, </p>
  <p>after 3 minutes Goose showed up with his second hand Fiat  car.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fiat is the common car in Poland, looking  at the small car is adorable. </p>
  <p> In  addition, the gas in Poland  is really expensive.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is because all  thinkable taxes such as pollution and fuel are all added inside the gas  price.  </p>
  <p>Besides cars also need insurance  to be on the streets.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160036.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Inside is Goose with the peace sign, I am  very happy to meet up with him without any problem.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Goose took me ahead so I slowly rode to his  dorm, just short 10-minute ride.  </p>
  <p>Today I  wouldn’t have to camp anymore, I am so happy!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160037.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is the entrance to Goose’s dorm.  For Goose’s privacy, I won’t post Goose’s  picture online.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160043.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just my luck, the dorm elevator is broken  today, carrying lots of bags going all the way to the 5th  floor.  </p>
  <p>The bike is locked in the special  bike room on the first floor.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>With Goose we got up to the 5th  floor, this is Goose’s room; he has been to Poznana for three years.  </p>
  <p>He knows everywhere in Poznana, he knows  enough to even write a book about Poznana.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking at the development in Poznana the last few years, </p>
  <p>it is amazing  after joining the European Nation, from transportation to business development,  </p>
  <p>all are moving forward at their own rate.   Here at Goose’s dorm.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160056.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Initially just meeting Goose a few times,  it was because of Apple Computers so we know each other’s username online.  </p>
  <p>Then I was working at the Apple computer  store, and one time he wanted </p>
  <p>to take a PowerPC Power Book 17” from Taiwan to Poznana, so I used my  employee discount to help him.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  happened back in December 2005, and it has been so long. </p>
  <p> This time I am taking lots of baggage  traveling half way across the world to Poland to meet him.  </p>
  <p>One traveling abroad must get help from  friends.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160052.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am not sure why there is a watermelon on  the floor; I am using it to put my safety helmet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After arriving to the dorm, I am trying to  figure out how I can stay with Goose in this dorm for the next few days? </p>
  <p> I am ok sleeping on the floor or hallway, but  I don’t want to bother someone’s schedule.   </p>
  <p>Goose already asked the Taiwanese Business Bureau here a few days </p>
  <p>after  I left Beijing  if there are any dorms I can stay in for a few days.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Luckily there are really free dorms I can  stay in, however long I would like, </p>
  <p>as long as I don’t stay past the visa  expiration date.  I left most of the  luggage at Goose’s place, </p>
  <p>just took a bag containing changing clothing before I  went to the dorm.  </p>
  <p>Here I can get hot  shower and clean bed to sleep for a few days.</p>

  <p>Poznana is so beautiful, I only used four  days to ride from the boarder.  </p>
  <p>If I push  myself a little, I can make it to Germany border in one day. </p>
  <p> It is disappointing to ride past this country  in just 5 days.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I decided I am going  to stay in Poznana for a few days since there is kitchen here,</p>
  <p> I can buy Ramen  noodle to live on as well.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Please  disregard when I vowed before of taking just 3 weeks riding to Paris or I will ride with only my underwear  on.  </p>
  <p>I was just saying things out loud;  please don’t put it to heart.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is  no reason to travel so fast, there is no limit to the time staying in Poznana,</p>
  <p> I will stay here until I am ready to leave. </p>
  <p> In the evening Goose took me in his car to the old town to eat dinner,  the night city is another look on its own.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160057.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because it is summer, the ladies are  dressed beautifully, in the winter they will cover themselves well.  </p>
  <p>If there is chance to visit here, must come  here during the summer. </p>
  <p> In addition,  Poznana is not a tourist city, there is not a lot of tourist here, but there is  lots of stuff worth seeing.  </p>
  <p>It is a good  place to come visit for a month.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160058.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  cost of living here is no worry either although it is a bit higher than Europe, </p>
  <p>but it is 4 times cheaper than the neighboring  German or France.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The same soda in Poland is $3, the same $3 in Germany,  </p>
  <p>except here they use Polish currency Zit and in Germany they use Euros.  </p>
  <p>The price is 4 times difference.  So one will have a great time in Poland without  being poor.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Goose  asked me if I wanted to take a shower?   </p>
  <p>Even though I am dirty right now, but I am even hungrier.  </p>
  <p>Lets fill my stomach first, something cheap,  good, and will fill me up.  </p>
  <p>It would be  better if somewhere has lots of meat, please show me the way Goose.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Goose  brought me to this restaurant, SPHINX, </p>
  <p>this is one of the big chain store in Poland, Polish  plus American fusion food.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160059.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  business is great today, the place is completely filled, it was around 9pm for  dinner, there are no empty seats left.   </p>
  <p>The waiting staffs all speak English, but Goose is able to use his  smooth Polish to answer.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160063.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Polish eating style, there are three types  of sauce, garlic, sweet &amp; sour, and salsa.   </p>
  <p>You can use anything with those sauces, French fries, meat, and bread;  it tastes good with anything.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160073.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The salad, tomatoes with lettuce plus a  huge piece of cheese, the cheese is good, light flavor.  </p>
  <p>It is a pleasure eating everything so  cool.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160075.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The appetizer, Goose recommended crab roll  with this mushroom sauce.  </p>
  <p>The pastry  rolled with steaming crabmeat, super tasty.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160079.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then comes the scary main meal, just one  portion for both Goose and I, we are completely full.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160086.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There is a huge portion of French fries,  two big portions of burgers, </p>
  <p>grilled chicken breast, grilled beef roll, BBQ  ribs, and BBQ pork chop.  </p>
  <p>Not only you  are drooling, even when I look at this picture now I am hungry all over again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This meal looks very American, but the  Polish side is hiding underneath.   </p>
  <p>Underneath this huge meal there is a layer picked vegetables, diakon,  cabbage, and purple radish.  </p>
  <p>Those  pickled vegetables are something that is on every Polish meal. </p>
  <p> If ordering a burger there, it will add lots  of pickled vegetable, very Polish style.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  eating this huge meal going back to the dorm for sleep.  </p>
  <p>This weekend Goose will drive the Fiat taking  me around the city.  </p>
  <p>On Monday when  school starts, it will just be me with Poznana map, another long vacation is  coming. </p>
