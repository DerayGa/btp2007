  <p class="style5">The Old City, Still With Its Glory</p>
  <p>The soft bed is here again, changing  between camping and comfortable surroundings.   </p>
  <p>After leaving MSI’s dorm in Moscow, I camped for another seven days  before I reached Poland boarder.  </p>
  <p>At the  boarder I stayed in another hotel to be freshened and energized.  </p>
  <p>After entering Poland it was another 3 days  of camping.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lying on the bed thinking about the places  I have camped, I have camped at various places.   </p>
  <p>The nicest place I slept in was the abandoned house, the most  interesting was the middle of the field, </p>
  <p>and the worst was when I got kicked  out when I was half asleep.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is just 2000km (1243miles) left to the trip, </p>
  <p>it can easily be  accomplished in 15 days as long as I watch for my own safety.  </p>
  <p>Once I enter Europe, it will be toward the  end of the trip.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If someone asks me how do I feel after  traveling alone for over 100 days?</p>
  <p>The people I met on the road said all said “you  crazy?” followed by unbelievable looks on their face.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking at the just harvested field,  nothing in sight, thinking how about camping here for the night, </p>
  <p>but at the  same time I am thinking am I crazy again? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Drinking with drunk Belarusian, eating birdseed,  even without common language we can still chitchat, </p>
  <p>but at the same time I am  thinking am I crazy? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Camping in the middle of the night with the  whole body shivering, rubbing my hands and arms against each other, </p>
  <p>but all I  felt was my goose bumps, but I am thinking am I crazy?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Of course, no doubt, I am crazy.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking  at the red Gobi Desert  under over 40C degrees  weather, </p>
  <p>riding in Kazakhstan  with nothing in sight, </p>
  <p>and riding in Russia freezing cold with my nose  running even during the summer. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If I didn’t ride this trip with a crazy  heart, I do not know how I can cross all those places.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are lots of ways to live a life, </p>
  <p>I  won’t judge how other people live theirs, because this is each person’s own  responsibility to themselves, </p>
  <p>their choices to live their life. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Rather, there are lots of people who judges  me, they use their values, limitations, </p>
  <p>religion, and their thoughts all to  restrict me.  </p>
  <p>All I can say is sorry, regardless how  reasonable you are saying, even if it is rules, so what?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After all, you are not I, </p>
  <p>and you will not  be able to understand what motives and reasons why I am doing this.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The most important, I never  live in someone’s expectations and praises, or blames and limitation, </p>
  <p>you can  call me selfish, big headed, but I don’t care how other people see me. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is who I am, I do what I want to do,  walk the roads I want to walk, </p>
  <p>go to places I want to go, and live the life I  want to live.</p>
  <p>I lay flat on the bed after my shower, and  I kept thinking and thinking, and my thoughts went into my dream, </p>
  <p>all the way  until morning.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160093.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In the morning, Goose drove taking me to  get some Polish money, Zit.  </p>
  <p>Even though  Zit is only useable in Poland, but it is a good currency.  </p>
  <p>Exchanging $100USD for Zit for me to use four  days here, plus the exit fee out of Poland should be enough.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160098.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is Goose’s Fiat, the body of the car  is green but the engine top is red.  </p>
  <p>The  red top is the result from Goose’s brother, Guerilla, hit a tree on some snowy  winter. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160106.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I am not sure if the car fixer place is  color blind, they didn’t care the color doesn’t fit, it is a car, </p>
  <p>it is  drivable, and so this is what it looks like now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  Poznana it is hard to find a place to exchange currency, </p>
  <p>all the signs are  Polish although inside they will exchange anything for Zit.  </p>
  <p>Although most of their business are for  eastern European countries that has not joined European Nation.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160110.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Using the exchange rate of $1USD to $2.9Zit  for $100USD, on the Zit all it shows are the king’s old face, </p>
  <p>although the  coins are this pretty gold color, it looks like gold coins, I am reluctant to spend  it now.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160111.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Although  when I entered Poland  I exchanged some USD to Zit at the grocery store </p>
  <p>they give me the exchange rate  of $1USD to $2.2Zit.  </p>
  <p>But since the  exchange was made at a grocery store, all I can say is too bad I got cheated  on, nothing I can do now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding in Goose’s car, there are lots of  red and yellow flowers planted in the middle.   </p>
  <p>Although the flowers are blooming very pretty right now, </p>
  <p>but when winter  comes with the snow the temperature is negative degrees, all those flowers  freeze to death.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160114.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When it comes to spring, Poznana will dig  up all the dead flowers and replant them.   </p>
  <p>This is to beautify the city, so they do this every year.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some street in Poznana, the Sphinx on the  left is where we had dinner last night. </p>
  <p> As you can see beautiful girls are everywhere, but in the winter the  girls are covered up.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160116.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>People  in Poland  follow the law, the cars on the road have the smallest rights; </p>
  <p>the first is the  pedestrians, then the electric cars and bus, the last are private cars.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Cars running on the street must follow all  signals, this include the lights, the signs,</p>
  <p> there is no horn sound heard on  the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160124.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Other than driving, people also follow  rules in parking.  Underneath the sign,</p>
  <p> there will be markings showing how cars should be parked, straight or  horizontal, </p>
  <p>or half way in and half way on the street, no detail left behind.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The sign on the right side of the photo  says the cars here all have to park </p>
  <p>on the street inside the gray lines and has  to be tilted, and here is free parking.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is Poznana’s business trade exhibition center, but this is just the  entrance.  </p>
  <p>Inside the space is huge, and  there are several buildings as well; just looking at the door of this place is  already amazing. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160122.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Before returning to the dorm, lets eat a  meal of the traditional breakfast here.   </p>
  <p>The purple vegetable and pickled vegetable is the norm here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160131.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is traditional Polish sweet bun; the  outside of the soft bread will be covered with chocolate or syrup, </p>
  <p>inside it  will also have jam or butter.  The flavor  is great and the price is cheap as well. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160134.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is traditional Polish coffee, this is  does not smell like coffee brewed by a machine.   </p>
  <p>Rather this is made by ground the coffee beans then add hot water  without stirring and presented to the customers.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160136.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Before drinking, one must be careful of stirring  well, and then wait a few minutes to let the coffee powder dissolve, </p>
  <p>this  tastes is very different from traditional coffee.</p>
  <p>After drinking all of the liquid, you  notice the undissolved coffee powder on the bottom of the cup.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160143.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>For breakfast just simple orders of French  fries, scrambled eggs with sliced sausages.   </p>
  <p>These are good but simple food with a big slice of bread, this takes  care of the lunch as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160139.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160141.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Map of Poznana, this one is posted on the  wall, but I got myself a personal map that includes suburb area of  Poznana.  </p>
  <p>Poznana is a big city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160149.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While  at Goose’s dorm this morning I used high speed Internet.  </p>
  <p>The dorm I am staying in has Internet problem  so I couldn’t get online.  </p>
  <p>So for the  next few days I will have to go to Goose’s dorm to use the Internet. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the afternoon I went to the old town to  browse around, </p>
  <p>that is Poznana’s oldest city and also the most popular city  center.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even though it is just the end of August,  </p>
  <p>but a lot of trees in the street already turned autumn colors.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In winter at Poznana, the sun doesn’t come  up until 8:30am, and it gets dark around 4pm.   </p>
  <p>The sight from then is totally different from now.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160150.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The dated buildings are usually built with  red bricks and red tile for roof;</p>
  <p> it is hard to guess what those buildings are  used for.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For example, these red  buildings are the largest obstetrics and gynecology hospital in Europe, </p>
  <p>each  year they deliver over 6000 babies. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160155.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Other than being a university town in  Poznana, it is also the largest medical center in Poland,</p>
  <p> it occupies important  medical field.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Another street, the tracks on the street  and the electrical lines on the top are for electrical cars.  </p>
  <p>If the cross walks doesn’t have traffic  signals, </p>
  <p>then the pedestrians always have the right of way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even if there is traffic signal installed,  only need to push this button </p>
  <p>and in a few seconds the light will change for  pedestrian right of way.</p>
  <p>Cars driving on the road have 24 lights on  policy, in the suburbs the speed limit is 70km, it is even slower in the city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160161.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>All  the buildings on the street have their own personal taste, there are beautiful  balcony and carvings seen everywhere.   </p>
  <p>Even with just browsing on the street with no destination in mind, this  is a wonderful city to tour around in.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160163.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If  lucky, one can even see hot air balloon with ads on them flying by, </p>
  <p>in this day  and age be able to see one of those is very rare.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160167.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The weather is good here on the weekend,  there was thunderstorm on Thursday, and it was cloudy on Friday.  </p>
  <p>But the weather is cooperating; when I reached  Poznana it is sunny, letting me to view the best possible.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160172.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The road with tracks on it, the cars can  drive on it as well.  </p>
  <p>On the older roads  they are not paved asphalt roads but stone paved. </p>
  <p> When cars drive by the road shakes, </p>
  <p>one has to  be careful biting their tongue when walking and driving on stone covered road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160174.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The police are not all over the streets  either, if it is just small mistake, </p>
  <p>for example like crossing the cross walk  and did not get off to walk the bike,</p>
  <p> and if the person didn’t know and made  this mistake, the police will let this time slide.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Parking the car next to the national  museum, there are random exhibitions.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160181.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The carving next to the front door, those  things are very lucky to escape being destroyed by the war.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160186.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>The mosaics on the sidewall of the museum.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160178.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The huge painting on the backside of the  museum.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160195.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Each painting should be a story, for anyone  who is interested can look for the story himself or herself.  </p>
  <p>For people who want can travel to Poland  themselves, the reward will be even better.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is mentioned before, the area to play soccer  is even shown with a picture, and a hilarious picture is shown.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160191.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Behind the red bricks with the wall covered  in stones is the old wall, inside the wall is the old city,</p>
  <p> but it isn’t old at  all; inside is full of life, beautiful, elegant, and full of culture.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160198.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The main city center of the old town is a  square in shape; it does not allow any car, not even bicycles.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160293.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160223.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Beautiful girls is seen everywhere, even  beautiful mothers, the least likely seen here are tourist.  </p>
  <p>If you have a chance to visit here, you might  be the only tourist here.  </p>
  <p>I will post  the front pictures of the beautiful girls later.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  is outdoors dining available at the square as well; they are all decorated  well. </p>
  <p> A lot of college students work  here, English is acceptable here. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160206.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are at least four fountains like this  one on the square.  </p>
  <p>This one is holding a  three-pronged trident so he should be Poseidon.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160211.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In the background there is a building with  green pointy top, </p>
  <p>it is Poznana   City Hall, it is sitting  right in the middle of the whole square.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All the carving here, each is carved just  like it is alive; this looks like a human frozen in time.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160291.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160345.jpg" width="900" height="1512" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The houses surrounding the square all have  distinct characters; </p>
  <p>the exterior, color, and style are all different.  </p>
  <p>They are all very colorful but not  shocking.  </p>
  <p>The outdoor dining areas on  the square mix in well do not destroy the look of the square.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160220.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160269.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160232.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The tallest one is the city office; it  looks like a mixture of a church and a castle.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160242.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Ancient buildings and carvings are seen  everywhere, and they are free for browsing.   </p>
  <p>They aren’t afraid for you to look, just afraid that you do not have  time to see it all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160227.jpg" width="900" height="1776" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the street outside of the square,  this is the center of the city center, </p>
  <p>and the whole Poznana is developed from  this point outward.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160229.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even the washing sink at the square seems  older than the people here,</p>
  <p> pushing on the bronze knob, cold water will come  out of the monster’s mouth.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160235.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Dirty water will exit in the sewer water; I  am not sure in this ancient city how the sewer system is designed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are very few vendors selling  postcards, flags, pinwheels, toys, clothing, and displays, just 2 or 3 of  them.  </p>
  <p>This is another sign of very few tourists  around.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160237.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The scary Teletubbies is here as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160351.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The strange plastic toys, after looking at  what is sold at flea market,</p>
  <p> the stuff is very normal compared to the things  sold at the flea market.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160353.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>All the postcards seen below are views of  Poznana.  </p>
  <p>From the postcards everywhere  seem very beautiful;</p>
  <p> I am not sure in these few days if I have time to view all  those places.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160352.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>Painting area, these are all real painting,  not copied works.  It depends on your own  view if it is good or bad.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160244.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is art school in Poznana as well, not  far from city center there is an art building with items that has useful art  pieces.  </p>
  <p>This means the art pieces are  not just for display but rather for use as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160246.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>For example, this chair shaped like a horn,  the building behind is the music instruments museum.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is another way to use art, in the  square the chairs are all weird shapes, </p>
  <p>some doesn’t even look like chairs, but  everyone sits there happily.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160347.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Walking halfway across the square you will  see City Hall building.  </p>
  <p>There is  painting and carving all over the wall.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160249.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>The carriage walking around the square,  there is a feeling of time going backwards to Renaissance time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The fountain in front of the city hall, the  carving is actually made out of stone, </p>
  <p>so this one wouldn’t oxidize and turn  green.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160257.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Poznana’s city sign is two goats’ head  against each other, just like the picture in front of this store.  </p>
  <p>There are lots of carving and pictures made  based off this picture seen everywhere in the city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160271.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In front of this restaurant the dried  floral wreath is beautiful, just like what is shown on the picture.  </p>
  <p>The chef’s recommendation meal here is  Cornish Game Hen.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160273.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The bar.   In Poznana the streets are named after famous people so the street name  are usually really long.  </p>
  <p>Thus the street  names are abbreviated to fit in the street sign.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160275.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Some bookstore building, this is Poznana’s  city planner; he is very good to plan Poznana to be the way it is today.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The below sign says “STARY RYNEK” which means  “old market”.  </p>
  <p>This sign is seen  everywhere in the four corners of the square.   </p>
  <p>All the buildings in the square all use this name, STARY RYNEK, as an  address.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160284.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The 89/90 sign on the door is the home  number, some homes will even has gas pipe number shown as well, </p>
  <p>this is in case  if something happens, the gas company will know which gas pipe they need to  deal with.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160279.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Another street connected to the square, the  car is only able to drive this far.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160306.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Since we are on the topic of cars, lets  mention about Polish drivers.  </p>
  <p>The cars  with an L sign on the top are all new drivers. </p>
  <p> Regardless how badly those new drivers drive, even mistakes that makes  the road backs up, </p>
  <p>there won’t be anyone honking at them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even though the L sign makes the car looks  idiotic, but the trade off is the enormous courtesy from other drivers.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160308.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is the parking meter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you park somewhere that requires pay,  prepay for a ticket and then leave it on the car windshield, </p>
  <p>otherwise the fine  is really high for no pay parking ticket.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are price differences for parking  depending on where, the red area is the most expensive,</p>
  <p> the green is the  cheapest, and the same goes the longer you park the more expensive it is.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For example parking for 10 minutes is $10,  but if continuously parking for 20 minutes it might be $30, </p>
  <p>and if parking for  total 30 minutes might be $100.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The reason for this is for the drivers not  to occupy one spot for too long, or don’t even driver the car out.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is in contrast to public  transportation, the longer you use it, and the cheaper it is. </p>
  <p> The reasoning is having everyone using public  transportation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Walking outside of the alley way will see a  whole brick wall still in perfect condition.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160310.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160313.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Inside this wall is art museum; I bet a lot  of the art pieces on the square are from them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are also history majors, so other  than studying at school, </p>
  <p>the students also responsible for maintaining the  church in this city.  </p>
  <p>Not only is this  putting what you learned into use, but also fusing the people and the city together,  </p>
  <p>so the city will always be part of people’s lives.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is also a Fiat, but it is locked up  due to having tickets.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160323.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>For cars with unpaid ticket, the cops will  just lock them up on the street.  </p>
  <p>The  driver can call the police station from the number shown on the lock, then someone  will come and hand you a ticket.  </p>
  <p>You  must pay the ticket right there, and then they will unlock the lock for you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is lots of street lightening, the  whole neighborhood is the same design, </p>
  <p>and so in the evening the lights will  give the city another look.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160324.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>For the bigger buildings, such as City  Hall, church, or castle, there are designated lights for the evening.  </p>
  <p>This makes the city safer even at night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160327.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This sign designate this is use for  bicycles only.  </p>
  <p>Riding on uneven road  like this, the bones in the whole body will shake to pieces.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160330.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Poznana tourist center, Goose got me a  copy of Poznana map and main attractions, </p>
  <p>so now I can tour around the city on  my own with the map.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160331.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160333.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Of course those are all free, in Europe as long as the sign has “i” on it,</p>
  <p> it is designed  for information, all the pamphlets are for taking.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Getting tired after the walk, so stopping  at the sidewalk café to rest;</p>
  <p> all the sidewalk cafes have great business,  almost everyplace is filled.  </p>
  <p>The decoration  isn’t cheap either; it feels like sitting in a garden.<img src="photo/P1160344.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is live band, performing around the  sidewalk café.  </p>
  <p>Pleasing music flows  through the whole square, with the addition of the church bells ringing at  times,</p>
  <p> the view, sound, and smell are all in enjoyment.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160350.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The very tiny coffee just a little bit  bigger than the thumb, filled 1/3 full, looks like someone has drunk it already.  </p>
  <p>But this is regular sized condensed coffee.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160339.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If you want water, order coffee first.  The restaurants here, </p>
  <p>or European restaurants,  water cost money, and might not be cheaper than beverage drinks.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is what I ordered, extra fancy peach  ice cream, and there are two sticks of cookies sticking out.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160342.jpg" width="900" height="1348" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After eating snack, we continue to browse  around.  </p>
  <p>There is no need to talk about  windows without ugly metal bars, </p>
  <p>the beautiful red flowers grown all over the  balcony is extremely pretty.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160357.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Walking away from the square, in somewhere  you will see this bicycle statue, postcards and tour guides all have him on it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160360.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>However, this famous statue isn’t a real  person.  </p>
  <p>Back in time this is a character  from a newspaper story, everyone knows him.   </p>
  <p>Maybe the statue I saw in Moscow of the grandpa on bicycle might have a  story behind him as well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Inserting a beautiful girl picture, Polish  girls are known to be the most beautiful girls in Europe;  </p>
  <p>they have excellent exterior, good character, beautiful with lots of energy,  and friendly as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160364.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On the streets you will see lots of girls  having weird hairstyles like you saw in magazines, </p>
  <p>they will also wear weird clothing;  Polish girls aren’t far away from what is hot in fashion.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Seeing so many beautiful girls, other than  being surprised, there is no time for pictures.   </p>
  <p>Please go to Poznana yourself if you like to see beautiful girls.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Streets in Poznana, the longer I see it the  better it is.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160365.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Eating dinner at this restaurant, the most  famous dish is their salad; the sign says Green Balcony</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160370.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is hard to eat fresh produce during the  trip, most of the time just juice.  </p>
  <p>When  I see fresh produce I will buy some to eat. </p>
  <p> When Goose brought other people here to eat their reaction was “coming  here is like eating grass” </p>
  <p>so I ask Goose bringing me here to eat a good grass  meal.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The restaurant has lots of small bees  hanging for decoration, each year the decoration changes; last year was sheep.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160372.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The restaurant has good vibe to it, and the  meal isn’t so shockingly expensive either.   </p>
  <p>This is similar to what you get in Europe, but the price is just 1/4 of  what you would normally pay in Europe.  </p>
  <p>I  plan to come to Poland in the future and take my time around to see everything.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160380.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The lamps on the table are pretty, and the  smell of tasty food flowing around, </p>
  <p>I am hungry, bring the menu fast so we can  order.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160374.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The waitress is a beautiful girl, she  happens to be the girl friend of Goose’s classmate.  </p>
  <p>Too bad she is taken already, so regardless  how good a friend anyone is at this point, </p>
  <p>all I can say they are monster  taking the beautiful girls.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160401.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The full and thick menu is written by hand,  it is not I don’t understand Russian or Polish; </p>
  <p>even looking at English menus  confuses me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160378.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even though the price here is cheaper than  the rest of Europe, but Pozana’s cost of  living rises every year as well.  </p>
  <p>The  same salad with pricing on the right side originally being $23Zit ($8.36USD) is  now $25Zit ($9USD); </p>
  <p>the same goes for originally $27Zit ($9.81USD) is now  $30Zit ($10USD).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After ordering just waiting for my good  meal.  The drinks came first; </p>
  <p>this is  cold red tea with the addition of watermelon balls.  </p>
  <p>The large sized cold tea with watermelons I  can eat, I recommend this.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160383.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160385.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>With Goose we are sharing a big plate of  salad, the portion here is amazingly large, </p>
  <p>anyone who can finish his or her  meal alone should be applauded.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Inside the basket there are utensils,  condiments, butter, bread, and a bottle of sweet and sour salad dressing.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160388.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The delicious salad is here, it is too big  and there are lots of goods underneath, one photo cannot fit it all.  </p>
  <p>For people who are just looking but can’t eat  it, just restrain yourself for this section.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160393.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On the very top of the salad are grilled  chickens; on the bottom there are lettuce, </p>
  <p>grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers, spouts,  and some dried fruit.  </p>
  <p>The salad has  honey sauce on it, taking a little of everything.  </p>
  <p>Each plate looks and tastes delicious, if you  say this is like eating grass is not giving it enough credit.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160399.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For people who are hungry and looking at  the wonderful meal above probably already run away for help;</p>
  <p> after eating a  wonderful meal, on the way home saw this ad prompting this famous artist named  Mucha.  </p>
  <p>He was born in the former  Austrian empire, but is Czechoslovakian. </p>
  <p> His painting style is like the poster, the people in the painting are  realistic style, </p>
  <p>and the clothing and background uses beautiful styles with  flowers and grass for decoration.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160405.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The time I am at Poznana happens to be the  same time for his art show, </p>
  <p>I will find some time to go see his painting  exhibition, continuously eating good food will deplete me of art cells.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before going back to the dorm we climbed to  this dorm which happens to be the oldest and the tallest one.  </p>
  <p>They were able to build something this tall  20-30 years ago;</p>
  <p> the exterior looks like a jail cell with thick carving feel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160407.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The dorm is very old; everything inside is  old including the elevator.  </p>
  <p>The door to  the elevator is a knob, the same way as opening a door by pulling out;</p>
  <p> it is  hard to see this is an elevator from the outside.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The architecture inside the dorm is old,  although we are not sure the condition inside the rooms itself.  </p>
  <p>It has been so old; it must be interesting if  living in there.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160423.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking at Poznana at the very top of the building,  the planning of this green city is amazing.   </p>
  <p>Other than the red roof tops, everything else is covered with green  trees.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160412.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is the first day touring in Poznana,  staying in this city for a while, not in a hurry to leave at all.</p>
