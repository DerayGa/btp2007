  <p class="style5">Nothing Is Strange Anymore</p>
  <p>Today  is Sunday, the second rest day in Poznana.   </p>
  <p>In my original plan, I had planned to leave Poznana tomorrow.  </p>
  <p>However, the plan has changed, this city is  worth to be walked around, I am in no hurry to leave.  </p>
  <p>Thus this has become one of the days I am in  Poznana.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Poznana  is a quiet city anyway, and on Sunday it is even quieter.  </p>
  <p>There is only the church bell heard on the  street since everyone has gone to the Sunday church service.  </p>
  <p>In this city with lots of churches around, </p>
  <p>I  randomly picked a church near the old city to observe the Sunday service.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160438.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>This  church looks very simple outside, but it is breath taking beautiful  inside.  </p>
  <p>The place is filled with people  coming for the Sunday service, and all the seats are gone.  </p>
  <p>The people that are just entering will have  to stand for the service.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  is a little boy dressed in black sitting on a stool by the front entrance  reading a book.  </p>
  <p>His clothing are clean  and elegant, it is hard to imagine he is actually a beggar.  </p>
  <p>The beggar in Poznana has high class.  They stand quietly on the street side, and  most are clean.  </p>
  <p>They look like they are  waiting for someone; the only difference is he has a collection box next to him  on the ground.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some  will ask you if you have any spare change?   Any cigarettes?  </p>
  <p>If the answer is  no, they won’t bother you, just smile and leave.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the first view after entering the church.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160440.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are lots of religious people; the ceiling inside the church is at least 5  stories high.  </p>
  <p>The prayer from the priest  and the elegant music mix together well.   </p>
  <p>Even though I am not religious, I can feel the respectful feeling.  </p>
  <p>This makes me feel I become a tiny person and  this sermon language surpass any human power.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160457.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>The  painting on the ceiling is very pretty, and the design in the whole place is  very exquisite.  </p>
  <p>This type of church is  spread through out if the city, and lots of them are open 24 hours a day.  </p>
  <p>So when anyone needs to be comfortered, they  can enter a church anytime.  </p>
  <p>It is fine  taking pictures, as long as there is no flash.   Don’t let one’s silly mistake become an international joke.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  am going to the flea market this morning.   </p>
  <p>Anywhere with cross walk there is this button you can push, after  pressing a few seconds, </p>
  <p>the light becomes green for people to walk across the  street.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160462.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  trees on the street grown so big, they probably didn’t’ expect it would grow so  big when they first planted it.   </p>
  <p>Therefore, the stone walkway rises from the tree’s roots.  </p>
  <p>In late August, it is already turning into autumn  with leaves flying everywhere.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160466.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  location of the flea market is at the abandoned mill with the big chimney.  </p>
  <p>The flea market is only open on Sundays.  </p>
  <p>Today most of the stores are closed, so I  came here to see another way of selling goods.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160468.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Walking  around the outside wall of the abandoned mill, the place inside is filled with  people visiting the flea market; </p>
  <p>this place has everything strange available  for sale.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160470.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  left side hanging with a yellow banner says flea market.  </p>
  <p>There is a biker parking his bike.  Chances are, the bike will be gone in a few  minutes.  </p>
  <p>The bike theft is very high in  Poznana regardless if it is a cheap bike or if one that is locked.  </p>
  <p>As long as the bike is away from eyesight,  the bike will be gone fast.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the first booth with items for sale as soon as I entered the flea market;  </p>
  <p>there are old clothing, painting, and some old frames on the table.  </p>
  <p>I can’t believe people will even sell this  type of things.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160473.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Actually,  these items are decent quality since some of the booths are selling items that  are close to trash quality, </p>
  <p>and the price are extremely cheap.  Rather than saying these are goods, </p>
  <p>this is  more like taking useless items from the dark corners of the home to sell,  </p>
  <p>putting everything under the sun and see who is willing to pay some money to  take them home.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160482.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before browsing I am getting some delicious  food to feed myself.  </p>
  <p>There are very few  food booths in the flea market; this BBQ booth is one of them. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160476.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There is gigantic sized sausage and  extremely thick pork pieces to select from.   </p>
  <p>The pricing is cheap considering the amount you will be getting.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160480.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>With  the addition of ketchup and yellow mustard plus a huge piece of bread, </p>
  <p>I will  die happy as long as I can be here eating a huge piece of sausage and BBQ pork.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160487.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  flea market sells everything strange here, </p>
  <p>after looking around for a while I  feel there is nothing that can’t be sold here, nothing is weird here.  </p>
  <p>There are lots of items here; I will just use  simple description below.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160474.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  metal items here are corroded; the silver items also are not shiny  anymore.  </p>
  <p>As long as anyone is willing to  pay and take some time to take care of the items,</p>
  <p> things that don’t look like  much will have a brand new look.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160493.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The item below is a corroded ax and a knife  for cutting.  </p>
  <p>One can easily cut spices  using this with some light pressure applied. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This open booth selling technology items is  very advanced already; </p>
  <p>there are ancient cell phones, CRT monitors, and the  first generation Play Station.  Oh the  memories! </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160498.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There is no price on any of the items at  flea market, it all depends on what the seller tell you, </p>
  <p>and then you can bargain  with them.  There is lots of room for bargaining.  </p>
  <p>Buying items here with bargaining is also a  fun feeling.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although Polish language is required.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Warsaw, lots of young  people can speak English, </p>
  <p>and very well, but the older people in Poznana can  only speak German,Russian, Spanish, and Polish.  </p>
  <p>English is the only language they are not  able to understand. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the same for people flying into  Poland.  </p>
  <p>At customs, the people who don’t  speak Polish the immigration officer is more troublesome, </p>
  <p>maybe not a little,  but a lot troublesome.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I had originally thought  since I was entering from Belarus into Poland </p>
  <p>with my Taiwan passport the  customs was being difficult to me.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, I found out even people taking international flight doesn’t  have an easy time either.  </p>
  <p>Even though  everyone has exited already, but the immigration officers grill people from  Taiwan.  </p>
  <p>It is very common here, the same  at Russia, regardless if traveling by self or traveling with a group. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So  many bikes, and the prices are very cheap, although the chances of getting  stolen bikes are pretty high.  </p>
  <p>Guerilla  already got 4 bikes stolen in Poznana.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160499.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  very ancient rifle, guns, sword, they are all real items, although one will  need to find bullets to fire the items.   </p>
  <p>These items are probably 50 years or older, they can easily be displayed  at any museums.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160501.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A  very big duck toy placed in the middle of a cart at the flea market.  </p>
  <p>This looks like a lucky toy, if I have money  I can buy it, </p>
  <p>and the next time when I come to the flea market again the lucky  toy will become another one.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160503.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is filled with people, complimented with a nice sunny day.  This is the perfect activity after Sunday  service.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160504.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  mealtime here isn’t three times a day.   </p>
  <p>They start their breakfast at 8am, followed by 10am snack with the lunch  at 3pm.  </p>
  <p>Finally, right before bedtime  with dinner at 10pm.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  are four meals a day, and each meal is different.  </p>
  <p>Some are just cold bread, although the  afternoon lunch meal is the most important meal for the day.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160507.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The booth selling shoes, this booth is nice  in the way that they will put two shoes of the same next to each other.  </p>
  <p>The other booths all have shoes in a big  pile.  It would require luck to find two  of the same shoes. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160512.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  was tempted to buy this alligator slipper, too bad my feet is so big, </p>
  <p>I will  continue to wear my blue and white slippers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They even sell the blue bear cookie tin,  everything on the table is $2Zit ($0.9USD) each, approximately $25NT.  </p>
  <p>There are no organization to what is placed  on the table, it is similar to garage sale.   </p>
  <p>If there is organization to the goods, then it is more like second hand  store. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160516.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This booth is selling clothing, they are more  elegant than some of other booth, </p>
  <p>and they are displaying it hanging off a  Fiat. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160520.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  guy of this booth asked me if I am willing to trade their ZENIT film camera for  the LX2 digital camera I am holding.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160530.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Trading one for one, I wouldn’t need to pay  anything extra!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This sounds like a good trade; of course  this means good business for the guy.   </p>
  <p>The ancient camera looks good, but I said no.  The guy then kept adding to the trade.  </p>
  <p>It ended up being one huge video camera, a  ZENIT film camera, </p>
  <p>an ancient radio, plus a strange championship cup for the  trade.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Polish people are very  interesting, of course I still said no to the trade.  </p>
  <p>This is because I would need to buy lots of  films for the rest of the trip photos.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Flea market style selling, some of the booth  selling watches that are extremely cheap,</p>
  <p> but the watch are all out of  battery.  </p>
  <p>After purchasing the watch, one  will need to purchase battery for it, </p>
  <p>and the cost of the battery is more than  the watch itself.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160532.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>People with time in the morning can definitely  get neat items for cheap price.  </p>
  <p>However,  the things may not be useful, maybe one day wake up and wonder why did I buy  all those things originally?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However,  the feeling of finding treasure and browsing around in the middle of bargaining,  is an amazing happy feeling.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Booth selling old books, comics, magazines,  and CDs.  </p>
  <p>There are lots of bookstores in  Poland.  The number of bookstores in a  town also reflects the literacy in that town.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160538.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160558.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  looks like DVDs, they don’t look like second hand items, rather illegal  copies.  </p>
  <p>After entering Europe there are  more sexual content items available.  </p>
  <p>The  other countries I had passed before are more conservative.  </p>
  <p>This is the same type of store next to the  bus stop.  </p>
  <p>However, the items for sale in  Poland are different from the ones in Russia.   </p>
  <p>The difference will be even greater as I travel west. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160540.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Store  selling mirrors, I am really a vampire, that is why the mirror doesn’t show  me!  Sneeze!  I am cold!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160545.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The very ancient radios.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160550.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>By selecting one with good condition, then  resell it to someone who understands who this is will bring lots of money.  </p>
  <p>Because this is vacuum tube type radio, the  size is big.  </p>
  <p>Once the radios are made of  electronic chips, they become smaller.   </p>
  <p>The age of those radios should be more than 100 years old.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some  booth will sell tea, coffee, or canned goods.   </p>
  <p>Those types of things are dangerous, even more dangerous than ancient  rifle.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160562.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The exterior looks perfect and pretty.  But flipping to the bottom, the expiration  date has already been scratched off.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160561.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Continue  selling things that are not sure how long this has expired; I suggest just purchasing  this for collection.  </p>
  <p>If someone you don’t  like visits you, then you can make him a cup of this tea.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Traditional  disc, the product is in pristine condition, not much different to new  items.  </p>
  <p>However, purchasing this type of  item will also require machine that will play them.  </p>
  <p>Or buying this type of item will just for  collection.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160557.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is U2’s music and the cover is  pretty. </p>
  <p> One can find ancient musical and  music goods, no wondering what you like you can find things you want at the  flea market.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  are too many interesting items here.  </p>
  <p>If  I talk about everything I will never stop.   </p>
  <p>This type of market is available everywhere including Taiwan. </p>
  <p> I encourage you to go and discover what you  can find. </p>
