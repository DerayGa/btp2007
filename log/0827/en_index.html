  <p class="style5">The Solemn and Respectful Big Church</p>
  <p>The  biggest problem has been solved in Poland, </p>
  <p>after both the front and the rear tires  of the bike were changed.  </p>
  <p>All that are  left are just small things that need to be fixed; </p>
  <p>Goose and Guerilla together  fixed the rest of the problems.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160594.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because  of my stupidity, I forgot to unplug a wire on the bike when I changed the  tires. </p>
  <p> I kept wondering why the front  tire wouldn’t come off, was it caught on something?  </p>
  <p>So after my very hard pull, the wire that  connects the night-light on the bike was broken.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The wire has been broken for over a month,</p>
  <p> I  didn’t want to mention this since I was afraid people would worry </p>
  <p>about me and  I coudln’t fix this wire immediately. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I  was pretty sure I would hear lots of concerned comments about </p>
  <p>riding at night  without any lights to guide me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160575.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So  I know I have to find a resting place everyday before nightfall, and not ride  in the dark.  </p>
  <p>I have been safe all the  way so far, and finally I can ride normally with everything fixed.  </p>
  <p>Guerilla connects the positive and the  negative wires back, </p>
  <p>using electrical tape to tape the ends.  Now the bright bike headlight is working  normally again.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160589.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Goose  and Guerilla both attend medical school here in Poland.  </p>
  <p>They are very self-dependent on DIY things  such as fixing the bike. </p>
  <p> Really, one  needs to know how to do everything when living overseas.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  front carrier lost a screw for over three months by now, </p>
  <p>and now the whole  screw hole is completely flat.  </p>
  <p>I had  thought there was no way to fix this problem, but Guerilla figured out a  solution.  </p>
  <p>Guerilla put plastic tubing  with screw line inside the screw hole, </p>
  <p>and then used a smaller screw for the  hole.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After that we used zip ties to  fasten the carrier.  This is another  problem solved.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160587.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  were other things such as the meter counter that was loose. </p>
  <p> I had secured the meter counter with plastic  tape, </p>
  <p>but now the meter counter is secured with double sided tape plus zip  ties.  </p>
  <p>After changing to the new rear  tire, the bike makes this clocky noise.  </p>
  <p>Guerilla suggests changing to a new chain, and  then readjust the speed changer, </p>
  <p>this sounds like a huge task at hand.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was worried this would take too much of  their time so we decided not to do this part for now,</p>
  <p>considering Goose and  Guerilla are starting school tomorrow,</p>
  <p> and facing heavy classes at the medical  school ahead.  </p>
  <p>So the bike fixing up  stops at this point for now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today  we aren’t driving the Fiat around town; rather we are taking the bus.  </p>
  <p>The bus uses the same type of tickets as the  electronic bus, which is counted by amount of time riding the bus. </p>
  <p> In the same amount of time there is no  restriction on how many bus changes one can make.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160571.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  the future when I walk around town I would probably take the bus as well, </p>
  <p>so I  asked Goose to show me once how to take the bus, so I would know how to ride  the bus. </p>
  <p> The bus stop has signs showing  which car would stop here.  </p>
  <p>The white bus  with black wording car is one type, the black bus with white wording is the  night bus, </p>
  <p>and the red bus is the special bus.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160595.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  destination is a huge church in the desert; we can reach it by taking bus  63. </p>
  <p> Inside the bus, there is a sign  showing which stops this bus makes, and how long it takes to go to each  stop.  </p>
  <p>In general, it takes 1-3 minutes  between each stop.  </p>
  <p>This way, the rider  can figure out how long one needs for the bus ticket.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160605.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  small print below the bus stop is the street name, and it also includes other  information for bus change.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  connecting area in the bus has wide space, there is total of three bus doors,</p>
  <p> no designation which one is for boarding and exiting.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Whenever a bus reaches a stop, one must press  a button outside the bus before the door opens for boarding, </p>
  <p>the same goes for  exiting the bus.  The driver is only  responsible for driving the bus.  </p>
  <p>He is  not responsible for opening/closing the doors, selling tickets, or inspecting  the tickets.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160610.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Riding  the bus and the electrical bus is depended upon one’s conscious; it is very  easy not to pay the fair.  </p>
  <p>Because some  people have monthly or yearly bus passes, </p>
  <p>they do not have to insert their  ticket every time they board a bus.  </p>
  <p>The  people with monthly or yearly passes only have to show their ticket when  someone asks to inspect their tickets.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160615.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>One  buys the ticket before they board the bus, </p>
  <p>you can easily purchase tickets in  the little stall near by, buy 10 gets 1 free.  </p>
  <p>After you board the bus, you insert the ticket, and no one watches  you.  </p>
  <p>Once awhile someone asks to inspect  your ticket, </p>
  <p>I am not sure how much he or she will fine you for no ticket.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  bus fare gets cheaper as time goes on.   Every 10 minutes is one unit,</p>
  <p> the price is $1.3Zit approximately $15NT  ($0.5USD)</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160619.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>For  $15NT, one can ride the bus for approximately 10 minutes.  </p>
  <p>Counting after one boards the bus, it is  about 5 stops or so.  </p>
  <p>If one submits 2  tickets when they board the bus, then one can ride about 30 minutes. </p>
  <p> If one submits 3 tickets, then one can ride 1-hour  bus in one setting.  </p>
  <p>There is also one  unit for 30 minutes ticket available,</p>
  <p> this way one would not need to submit 2  tickets when they board the bus.  The  student ticket is half price.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  yearly bus pass is amazing, approximately $200Zit ($73USD), average  $2USD/day.  </p>
  <p>The yearly pass is paid off  with just a ride every other day. </p>
  <p>In  addition, the yearly pass has no limit on what time one can take the bus, and  the quantity of the rides.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At  first, one feels it is troublesome to use timing for bus price unit, </p>
  <p>but with  the same ticket under the same time unit one can change to any other bus.  </p>
  <p>Besides, the longer the bus ride goes, the  cheaper it is, thus this type of bus fair calculation do benefit the riders.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  am curious if any other country other than Poland use this type of time unit  bus calculation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  sign at the bus stop states clear what time the bus arrives.  </p>
  <p>The left is weekday bus, the middle is the  Saturday bus, and the right side is the Sunday bus.  </p>
  <p>The bus schedule is from 5am to 11pm  everyday.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160620.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  right side listing shows the stops the bus has made.  </p>
  <p>The bold wording with arrow next to it is the  name of this particular stop.  </p>
  <p>And the  sign also shows the amount of time one needs between the following stops. </p>
  <p> The current location is Katedra stop, which  is the desert area in the middle of a river.   </p>
  <p>There are also two very old and pretty churches near by.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160623.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  getting off the bus, one will see the pointy church building.  </p>
  <p>To get across the street one takes the  underground walkway.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160624.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are some graffiti on the walls of the underground walkway, but in general the  whole area is clean.  </p>
  <p>Walking in Europe,  one usually sees a beautiful church building around any corner.  </p>
  <p>Walking in the street of Poland, one sees  beautiful girls walking by any time, it is good to be alive.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the entrance to the church.  There are  two buildings to the church.  </p>
  <p>The left is  the one over 1000years old and hasn’t been destroyed by war, still in top  condition.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160626.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  right church is one with twin pointy tops with a priest delivering a  sermon.  </p>
  <p>The Roman Catholic Pop John Paul  2nd has also visited this church in the past.  </p>
  <p>Too bad this church was partly destroyed in  the Second World War, and has been reconstructed.  </p>
  <p>The exterior looks newer, although everything  inside is ancient including the sitting stool.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the church on the left, built in 968A.D., count with your fingers to see how  old it is.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160641.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is memorial statue left from Pope John Paul 2nd’s visit.  </p>
  <p>The little oil lamp on the bottom is a  tradition of Poland.  </p>
  <p>For Halloween in  the US people eat pumpkin and ask for candy.   In Poland, people visit graveyard and light a lamp.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160630.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  the evening, there is a lamp lighted everywhere; it would be hard to forget  this kind of scenery.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160644.jpg" width="900" height="1367" /></p>
  <p>In  the front of the big church, it is built with red bricks.  </p>
  <p>The top areas are all spring grass color, </p>
  <p>not  sure if this is from oxidation or if they selected this type of building  material on purpose.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160636.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  stained glass window from the outside looks normal, </p>
  <p>but once inside, one can  see the light shinnying in with lots of colors. </p>
  <p>The outside is already pretty, but the inside is amazing. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  front entrance is very low key, it is also very rare for me to visit the inside  of a building on this trip.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160652.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/T6JAPZPHaGE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  entrance has two hanging lights; those are only lighted up in the evening.  </p>
  <p>At the same time, the church has special  lightening system at nighttime.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160829.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Normally  this is where I stop talking about the church,</p>
  <p> but today is different, this is  just the beginning of my introduction.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Because  I am not very knowledgeable in religious matters, </p>
  <p>I am not going to talk about  anything other than normal things, just in case it becomes a laughing  stock. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> If there is anyone with Catholic  background and will supplement information regarding these photos,</p>
  <p> I will be  very grateful.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  will be more photos at the bottom than words, please browse at your  leisure. </p>
  <p> Once I get supplement  information, I will explain photos one by one so everyone can be informed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before  we enter, let’s mention basic manners in visiting a church.  </p>
  <p>Shorts, tshirt, hats, and shades are frowned  upon inside a church.  </p>
  <p>In addition,  regardless how dark it is inside, do not use flash while taking pictures.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160817.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lets  start,</p>
  <p>The  carving above the front entrance.  </p>
  <p>By  looking at the color of these carving they should be silver, but probably  oxidized already.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160654.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The carving on either side of the front  entrance is carved with detail. </p>
  <p>I haven’t  even gone inside and already can feel the religious feel.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160819.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160823.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>This feels similar to the wall painting in  Tibet, other than being art item, those paintings also tell stories.  </p>
  <p>Each painting tells a history or a Bible  story. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160836.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If the photos are a little pixilated,  please accept them as they are. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking out of the windows after entering  the church, </p>
  <p>the sunlight looks too bright compared to the environment from  inside the church.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160833.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160655.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  stained glass window that isn’t any special now displays its colorful glory  from the inside.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160792.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>從外面看不出端倪的彩繪玻璃，一幅幅都展現出了她的美麗姿態。</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160799.jpg" width="900" height="1033" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160699.jpg" width="900" height="885" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  main seating area, after the Sunday service it is empty.  </p>
  <p>However, on Sundays this place is packed with  people.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160808.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160674.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once entering the church one will see two  stone carved statues holding the holy water.   </p>
  <p>There is only a little holy water inside, dip your finger in it to mark  the cross,</p>
  <p> followed by kneeling down in front of the cross. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160814.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is armor next to it, this person  looks like a knight with his name and the description on the wall, </p>
  <p>it is a burial  place inside. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160659.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are lots of burial places like this inside the church.  </p>
  <p>By looking at the carving one can see what  this person used to look like.  </p>
  <p>Even  though it is a grave inside, but I don’t feel fear here.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  church is separated into a main area, and separate smaller areas connected by  the halls on either side.  </p>
  <p>Each area has  different displays, mainly showing art, statue, burial place, and stained  glass.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160664.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160668.jpg" width="900" height="588" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160682.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160751.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are burial places everywhere, and the people who are buried inside the church  must be important people, </p>
  <p>probably people who are either priest or ones that  contributed to Poznana.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160686.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  are smaller halls not open to the public, people can not enter without special  permit.  </p>
  <p>Those areas will have fence  blocked outside.  Even though I couldn’t  enter,</p>
  <p> I could still see the beautiful displays through the fence.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160710.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160692.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160758.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here  is a display of a famous art, St. Mary in red.  </p>
  <p>The original has already been removed to elsewhere.  </p>
  <p>According to legend, when there was war-attacking  Poland all the way to this church, </p>
  <p>this painting had red tears dripping down. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160719.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On  closer inspection, this is a painting with 3-D effect, on the top of St. Mary  there is also a gold halo.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160715.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the small display room deep inside  the church so call the gold prayer room.   </p>
  <p>This is because everything inside is made of gold.  It costs money to visit inside. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160722.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  camera couldn’t catch the gold feel, however the view in this room is shocking  to the human eye.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  ceiling on the gold prayer room.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160725.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  painting and carving on the window. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160734.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  painting on the wall and everything else are made with gold.  </p>
  <p>Even though the church had made everything in  gold, it doesn’t not have an expensive feeling to it;</p>
  <p> rather it provides a  luxurious indulgence feeling for the art pieces.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160735.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  floor to the gold prayer room, there are letters outside the circle, I am not  sure what language it is in.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160741.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is the burial place inside the gold room.   This person has a huge hat on; he must have been an important person.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160745.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A normal looking painting on the wall, but  I can’t imagine the history of this painting.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160747.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the view from the front seating area, the left is a fancy decorated staircase,  and on the bottom is a table.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160779.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  the front is a glorious gold statue; there is stained glass above.  </p>
  <p>The front table is used for service.  </p>
  <p>Anyone enters the church will keep their  voice low; even breathing has become lower sound.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the book below; I am not sure what is inside.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160766.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Wow,  finished with the tour, this tour is comparable to visiting 33 buildings in  Tokyo.  </p>
  <p>Walking outside to be surrounded  by beautiful girls in Poland.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160827.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  floor here is all traditional stone ground,</p>
  <p> they are still in top condition  even after being stepped on for hundreds of years.  </p>
  <p>This is amazing architecture since in Taiwan  the walkways are constantly in broken or chipped stages.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the mosaic art by the main entrance;  this is completely made with pieces of colorful stones. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160843.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The fire extinguisher outside the church  also has the church’s mark.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160855.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the backside of the church, there are lots of pointy rooftops, </p>
  <p>and I am not  sure how to get up there from inside the church.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160862.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  are no stray dogs in Poznana, although there are lots of pretty girls walking  with their dogs.  </p>
  <p>Each year the popular  breed of dogs changes, sometimes it changes to a mini dog.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If  there is a collar on the dogs, so there must be an owner.  </p>
  <p>The cats are not as controlled.  There are two cats sunning behind the  church.  </p>
  <p>The cats look very clean, and  not afraid of strangers.  </p>
  <p>When I put my  hand over there the cat will come over for petting, </p>
  <p>so the cats probably have  owners, and allow them to roam around the church area.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160884.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>People who like dogs or cats must be  different, considering these two types of animals have different personality. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was hungry after touring the church.  I ate dinner at this Indian restaurant next  to this huge man made lake. </p>

  <p>This  man made lake also has lots of history behind it; they have yearly rowing  competition here.  </p>
  <p>There is also a place  for people to run and look around, very good for people to ride their bikes  here as well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The very elegant Indian restaurant next to  the lake, time for my big meal.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160892.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>People who are hungry please look away or  go get something to eat before looking at the rest of the photos.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the menu, do you understand  it?  The meals are under $30ZIT ($11  USD), approximately $400NT each.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160896.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is all curry meals here; there is lamb,  fish, and chicken.  </p>
  <p>There is no pork or  beef, but unlimited rice.  When one is  hungry this will be a great meal.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While  here, I should explain other European nation’s pricing.  </p>
  <p>The restaurants that don’t provide drinking  water are the norm.  </p>
  <p>In a normal Italian  restaurant, a glass of drinking water cost $8 Euro ($2.90USD), approximately  $300NT. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A  bottle of 500cc Coca Cola is approximately $14 Euro ($20USD) </p>
  <p>or $600NT when  purchased at a small side vendor in Italy.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The cost of living in Europe is very high,</p>
  <p> just to think when I traveled around France for 51 days cost $100,000NT  ($3333USD), </p>
  <p>approximately $2000NT ($60USD) each day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Besides  I stayed in the hotel everyday, and it was in July and August,</p>
  <p> the busiest time  to travel.  Although it was very cheap  back then.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The average meal price on the menus will  stay similar after arriving to Europe, </p>
  <p>except now all the money changes to  Euro.  It would be hard to eat a meal  less than $100Euro ($150USD).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After looking at the cost of living in  Europe, </p>
  <p>the cost of living and traveling in Poland is pretty cheap in  comparison.  </p>
  <p>The cost of traveling  cheaply in Poland for a month is the equivalent of traveling for a week in any  other European countries.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  appetizer is this fried shrimp, this is pretty good.  </p>
  <p>However, one has to be careful eating seafood  in Polish cities that are not near any body of water, </p>
  <p>it is common to get  stomach ach.  The salmon sold here is  this weird brownish color.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  seafood sold in the market is from when they are fresh all the way to ready to  go bad, </p>
  <p>and the price is expensive as well.   </p>
  <p>The seafood does not come off the shelf until they are to the point of  getting smelly, </p>
  <p>but they aren’t tossed away.   They are then smoked and sold again.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160903.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  are three types of seasoning, a green and two brownish ones, one of the  seasoning is spicy and delicious. </p>
  <p> I can  eat just 3 bowls of rice alone with the spicy sauce.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160901.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Of course with today’s good meal I don’t  need to eat just spicy sauce with rice.   </p>
  <p>I am hungry again just by looking at this picture. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160910.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Indian  food doesn’t look appetizing, but every meal is delicious.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After writing so many travel journals, </p>
  <p>I  found I am not very good talking about two types of things, one is art, and the  second is food.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Every time I see an art piece, what I write  doesn’t describe what I feel even to 1%.   </p>
  <p>This is the same with the meals I eat.   I am wondering how can I describe this is a tasty meal?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is no wonder in the Chinese Chef  picture every time when they eat a delicious meal; </p>
  <p>they have pictures of  dragons and phoenix flying. </p>
  <p> I know the  picture looks ridiculous, but for the people who are eating that meal that is  how they really feel.</p>
  <p>Traveling is a great thing to do, however,  I highly do not recommend traveling with big groups.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are two types of self-traveling, one  is by self, and one is with friends.</p>
  <p>Independent traveling is another feel,  opening one’s view, and everything learned, </p>
  <p>especially when one returns after  traveling for so long.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>People ask what do you feel after traveling  to so many places?</p>
  <p>Even if you can’t answer that question, it  is ok, because inside your heart you know what you saw.  </p>
  <p>When you tell people what you learned is not  the same anymore,</p>
  <p> and people who are listening can’t understand what you felt  on your travels. </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Finally it isn’t necessary  to write the travel blogs.  </p>
  <p>It takes more  effort to write these than riding the bikes with the time spent organizing the  blogs. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There has not been one day where I  willingly wrote these blogs with details, </p>
  <p>using so many words and photos to  describe the details; this is harder than fighting an alligator.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I rather fight with an alligator than write  these blogs.  </p>
  <p>With the time spend  organizing these blogs, I rather go outside to breath the fresh air and walk  around the town.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Every time I write the blogs I pretend I am  writing to Misasa, </p>
  <p>this is because when I get older and forgets, at least these  can be memories for me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Because I am sad I couldn’t  take Misasa with me on this trip, so there is energy for me to write blog after  blog.  </p>
  <p>I feel bad not taking her with me,  thus I use these blogs to show her what I saw and see. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On a side note, there is no possibility to  publish a book from this trip since I wasn’t looking for money on this trip,  </p>
  <p>and then why publish a book to start an argument.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The people who like travel can read them  through the internet, and cut down less trees, </p>
  <p>print less paper, and let the  world be greener.</p>
