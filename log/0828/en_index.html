  <p class="style5">Dorm Dweller Goes Out</p>
  <p>Ever since arriving to Goose’s dorm,</p>
  <p> I have  stayed in completely in the room browsing the internet and writing the travel  diaries. </p>
  <p> I didn’t leave the dorm at all  on August 27th.  </p>
  <p>The travel diaries  from August 27th are actually the travel from the afternoon of  August 26th.  </p>
  <p>That night the  Poznana student from Taiwan  cooked a scrumptious meal for me to eat.   </p>
  <p>The person who cooked the meal for me was too busy to eat, they had to  go back to study for their test.  </p>
  <p>This is  so sad. T_T</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160931.jpg" width="900" height="506" /> </p>
  <p>Three Cup Chicken and Curry are great; the  meal also supplemented my lack of vegetables from previous meals.  </p>
  <p>If you have friends who are Indian, then they  would look down upon you for using curry seasoning cubs to make curry. </p>
  <p> It doesn’t matter as long as the flavor is  great.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The weather wasn’t good that  night, dark clouds were very low and dark.   </p>
  <p>The cold breeze at night makes the temperature keep going down.  </p>
  <p>Does this mean the few good weather days will  end?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160924.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After I got up, it was still blue  skies.  Good thing it didn’t rain or I  would stay in the dorm for another day.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160942.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When  I turn on the computer and started typing on the keyboard,</p>
  <p> looking at the  bright sunlight with white clouds outside makes me want to find an alligator to  fight. </p>
  <p> If I win, then I wouldn’t need to  write the travel diaries anymore. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A  little past three Goose came back from his class. </p>
  <p> He opened the door and saw me still in the  dorm and said “Wow, are you a dorm dwelling male?”  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Actually, it isn’t terrible being a dorm  dweller.  </p>
  <p>However with the nice weather  today, and I just finished the travel diaries,</p>
  <p> I can finally go out joy riding  the bike with no destination in mind.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today I want to prove that I wasn’t talking out of air about Poznana’s  beautiful girls.  </p>
  <p>The below photos are  taken within an hour.  </p>
  <p>I have also  included the photos Goose took of the beautiful girls on street.  </p>
  <p>People who want to look ahead and skipping  useless talks can do so.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Those photos do  not need words to describe.  </p>
  <p>From this  photo you can see the yellow pedestrian walking button on the traffic  light.  </p>
  <p>A few seconds after pressing the  button, the light will change to green. </p>
  <p> The pedestrians follow the traffic signal and walk on the pedestrian  walk way. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160946.jpg" width="900" height="613" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>MPK is the abbreviation for Miejskie  Przedsiębiorstwo Komunikacyjne, the city’s public transportation office.  </p>
  <p>Here it sells the tickets for cable cars and  buses.  </p>
  <p>The stores on the street also  sell tickets, but the MPK office do a bit more such as adding value to the  monthly pass.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160947.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is the final stop for the cable  car.  </p>
  <p>Poznana’s cable car is very long but  not as wide so it doesn’t give the fatness feeling.  </p>
  <p>The entrance hangs a sign says [Solid  Security], the security company.  </p>
  <p>When I  was camping at Warsaw,  twice this security company asked me to leave.   </p>
  <p>This means they take their jobs seriously.  Even though that is annoying but it also  means they are trustworthy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160950.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the little frog convenience store seen all over Poznana.  </p>
  <p>Shopping here means picking out what you want  yourself and pay at the counter. </p>
  <p> This  isn’t like Russia’s  conservative shopping style. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160951.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  weather is extremely great.  The roads  used by cars, cable car, and bikes all have marked out on the street. </p>
  <p> Everyone uses the roads they are suppose to  take as long as there is a sign indicating </p>
  <p>on where each is suppose to go, or  else a ticket soon follows.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160954.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If  there is no sign for bike path, in theory it means the whole city is bike  friendly.  </p>
  <p>However, when crossing the  street I must get off the bike and walk the bike, or else a ticket  follows.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The cable car has large windows  for viewing.  </p>
  <p>Sitting in it allows  viewing of the whole city.  I constantly  see girls handing out advertisements on the street</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160957.jpg" width="900" height="624" /></p>
  <p>Cable  cars have different colors although yellow with green ones are most  common.  </p>
  <p>This blue cable car is also  pretty. </p>
  <p> The street lights all have been  designed which makes any photos on the street a beautiful postcard.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160958.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is Poznana’s tradition; the streets are named after famous people.  </p>
  <p>The street names uses whole names so each  street name is very long.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160963.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Underneath  the street sign there will also be photo and biography of the person,  </p>
  <p>explaining what the person did for Poznana.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160980.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the poet Adam Mickiewicz’s memorial park.   </p>
  <p>The fountain is beautiful with lots of people lying on green grass  sunning on it.  </p>
  <p>There is a big building  right across from the fountain. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160969.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is the national theater which shows  cases first class opera performance with cheap tickets. </p>
  <p> This allows the public to experience art  without having to pay a lot.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160973.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  best seat of the house is close enough to smell the perfume </p>
  <p>on the performer  with one ticket less than $600 NT (~$19 USD).  </p>
  <p>At this price in Taiwan,  the only available seat is the one requiring a binocular to see the small  people on the stage.  </p>
  <p>The cheapest ticket  here is about the same as buying a bottle of soda.  </p>
  <p>Most of the operas are performed in Italian  with Polish subtitles. </p>
  <p> If there is a  chance to visit inside, then it is also an experience.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the traditional yellow with green  cable car.  I have only ridden the bus  but not the cable car yet.  </p>
  <p>Other than  the fact that the cable car drives on the tracks, all the traffic rules apply  as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160975.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>All  sort of architecture is seen, not only is there red bricks with green roof, all  styles of building are seen in Poznana.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160976.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Today  there is a red bus with a yellow cross sign on it parked in front of Adam  Mickiewicz’s statue.  </p>
  <p>The bus also has  hospital writings on it.  This looks like  a mobile blood donation bus.  </p>
  <p>The  background is a castle, maybe a past king lives here.  </p>
  <p>There are lots of Mucha’s posters all over  the city; there is also a Mucha poster on the castle.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170001.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I went over to the blood donation bus and  asked if foreigners can donate blood as well?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1160995.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>However,  neither of those 2 girls are staff but pretty girls who are donating their own  blood as well.  </p>
  <p>They told me foreigners  should be able to donate blood but the forms are in Polish. </p>
  <p> I would need to find someone who can translate  the form for me so I can fill the form out.   </p>
  <p>This is too bad because if the 2 girls are nurses and asking for blood  donation, </p>
  <p>80% of the guys would be willing to donate all their blood.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  building is next to the castle, which is the building hosting Mucha’s art  exhibition.  </p>
  <p>The art exhibition lasts  until November for this Czechoslovakia  artist.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170041.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Based  off this poster, Mucha’s art is a danger to Lolita Complex.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It  is very common to see beautiful girl walking a big dog.  </p>
  <p>However, I only saw a little girl walking a  strange dog today.  </p>
  <p>There are a lot of  dogs here but very few dog poops on the street.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170004.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some  square in the city.  The surrounding  buildings are the main branch offices of big banks.  </p>
  <p>The building closest is the largest chain  book store in Poznana.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170013.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Most of the streets name signs hang on the  side of the building.  </p>
  <p>The signs on the  streets are signs telling distance to a destination or a particular  location.  </p>
  <p>Different locations use  different sign colors.  The type of signs  for Movie Theater and monastery are different.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170030.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are lots of pigeons in Poznana.  </p>
  <p>Other  than people feeding them bread, there are also places that have food and water  for the pigeons. </p>
  <p> All the pigeons are  well feed and not afraid of people. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170036.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  islands separating the streets are planted with alternating red and yellow  flowers.  </p>
  <p>The flowers are beautiful and  bloom for a long time, all the way until snow falls.  </p>
  <p>The flowers are replanted again during the  following spring.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is another  student passing out advertisement.  </p>
  <p>Most  of the Poznana female students wear a cap and pony tail, and carrying backpack  and earphone. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170042.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This building next to Adam Mickiewicz’s  statue, covered with greeneries, is the auditorium to a university.  </p>
  <p>There is symphony band inside, so there must  be high quality performance for people to enjoy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170051.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is the entrance to the art college. </p>
  <p> If  the entrance has a sign in white words with red background, </p>
  <p>it means the  building is a government office or an important building.  </p>
  <p>Those signs also mean the building is  available for the public to visit.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170053.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Another  view of greeneries.  Poznana is a  beautifully planned city with lots of greeneries; the air quality is also  great.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170055.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  is a taxi on the right side.  BMW isn’t  that unusual here; lots of BMW are used as taxis in Poznana.  </p>
  <p>A Fiat is more popular, and very cute a  swell. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170057.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The darker skin is like a burnt wheat  color, even though she is also a citizen of Poznana.  </p>
  <p>Poznana doesn’t have beaches but there are  lots of indoor tanning salons.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170059.jpg" width="900" height="587" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Regardless  how beautiful the girls are, they aren’t edible.  </p>
  <p>I ate a nice dinner in a famous restaurant in  the suburbs opened in 1937. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170070.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The decoration inside the restaurant is  clean and well lit.  </p>
  <p>There is even a  large yellow duck toy on display.  The  chef’s recommendation here is apple and duck.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170074.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Most  of the people come here order apple and duck.   The price isn’t cheap, 100g (0.22 lbs) cost $8 Zlit.  </p>
  <p>Half of a duck is about 500g (1.10 lb), which  is $40 Zlit ($14.6 USD); </p>
  <p>adding on $7 Zlit ($2.54 USD) worth of appetizer,  drink, and soup.  It cost about $700 NT  ($22 USD) per person.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170081.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  first dish is duck blood soup.  A special  technique is used so the duck blood doesn’t solidify </p>
  <p>with the addition of duck  gizzard and noodle dumplings.  The flavor  is like any other Polish dish, salty.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170090.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The main dish, apple and duck, half duck  grilled to perfection.  </p>
  <p>The skin is  crispy with tender duck meat and the addition of sweet grilled apples.  </p>
  <p>On the sides are some fresh vegetables and 2  bread buns.  Polish people also like  bread buns.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170096.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Half  of a duck is perfect for one person.  If  I eat a whole duck, I would be too full. </p>
  <p> If girls come, they would only need 1/4 of a  duck.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On the way back to the dorm I got  some ice cream from the store as dessert.  </p>
  <p>The store also sells vegetables.   The cheapest vegetables are potatoes; 1kg of potatoes is less than $1  Zlit ($0.36 USD). </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170097.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Taiwan has lot of potatoes that  are shipped from Poland  and then processed in Taiwan;  </p>
  <p>this means lot of people has eaten potatoes from Poland.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is the processed meat section in the frozen section.  It is rare to see beef in Poland.  </p>
  <p>The beef meat is skinny and expensive.  For 1kg (2.2 lbs) of beef it sells for $500  NT ($15 USD). </p>
  <p> Instead there are lots of  processed pork and chicken such as sausages, salted meat, and ham.  </p>
  <p>There is the bread bun on the top left, which  only needs to be heated a bit to be edible.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170111.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is getting close to the Chinese Moon Festival;  the moon in the sky is very bright and round.   </p>
  <p>The night in Poznana is different.   For people who prefer night time stores can also find night time  activities in Poznana.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170114.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After my meal and ice cream, Gorilla is  prepared to change the chain on the bike.   </p>
  <p>I took out the spare chain brought from Taiwan, so I am ready to solve the  chain problem once for all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170119.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Taking  off the old chain first.  When I changed  to the new tires previously, I added lots of lubricating oil.  </p>
  <p>This combined with the dust from the ride,  the bike is very dirty. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170124.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  am prepared to bring the old chain that just got taken off back to Taiwan.  </p>
  <p>This is much easier to carry than the old  tires.  Then the new chain, which RST  helped to obtain, is added onto the bike.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170125.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because  of my bike repairing skill, the new chain is snap on type which takes 3 seconds  to do.  </p>
  <p>After that it takes about 30  minutes to adjust the speed change on the bike.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170129.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  section is for Gorilla to do. </p>
  <p> The adjustment  is made so there isn’t no strange sound when speed changes, and the chain won’t  fall off the tooth on the bike.  </p>
  <p>This  does take someone with skills to do.  Once  the speed adjustment is done, I took the bike downstairs for a test ride.  </p>
  <p>This is a wonderful change from the past;  there is no more of strange sound and vibration.  </p>
  <p>This means the rest of the ride to Paris will be a lot  easier, </p>
  <p>and there is no need to change the chain for the riding trip around Taiwan in the  future.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
