  <p class="style5">Animals at the Zoo</p>
  <p>I  left early today carrying a backpack containing 2 bottles of water, some  chocolate biscuits, </p>
  <p>map, and a camera.  I  am going to Poznan’s  zoo today.  </p>
  <p>There is only one restaurant  in the zoo and a store selling zoo merchandise.   </p>
  <p>However, I don’t need to ask to know that the price at the zoo will be  expensive.  </p>
  <p>Whatever I need I will bring  on my own.  I got the map from the  visitor’s center.  </p>
  <p>The bus ticket was  bought previously.  I also got the map  that Goose drew for me. </p>
  <p> It contains the  direction from the dorm to the bus stop, which bus I need to take, </p>
  <p>and how I  get from the bus stop to the train station.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170130.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I passed by bunch of couples in love on my  way walking from the dorm to the bus stop.   </p>
  <p>Even though I am by myself, I am determined to enjoy myself on this  trip.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170133.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The bus stop across the street is where I  will need to board the cable car. </p>
  <p> I need  to take number 6 cable car.  I will pass  by 6 stops, total about 24 minutes.   </p>
  <p>Therefore, I need 2 tickets with 10 minutes each for the 30 minute trip.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170135.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Within  a few minutes, the cable car arrived.   </p>
  <p>The cars here can’t drive on the electric cable car track so there is no  traffic taking the cable car.  </p>
  <p>The  outside of the cable car looks very narrow, not sure how it will feel once I am  inside. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170145.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  cable car has 3 connecting sections.   </p>
  <p>Because there is no exact stopping point where the cable car stops at  the station, </p>
  <p>therefore one will need to press a button for the door to open  when the cable car gets to the station.   </p>
  <p>This way, there is no unnecessary doors opening and closing.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170138.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The little machine here punches the  ticket.  It is very simple, this machine  prints a time on the ticket.  </p>
  <p>The moment  the time count starts, is the time this ticket becomes in use.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170146.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Poznan got handsome men and  beautiful women. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even  though the cable car looks narrow from the outside, it is actually really  spacious inside.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170149.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The light shines  through the large windows.  I am satisfied  looking at the scenery while riding the cable car.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Because the cable car does not broadcast each  station’s name upon arrival, </p>
  <p>so one must be careful which stop he/she needs to  get out. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170150.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  am sitting on the chair reading the information Goose gave me.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Goose especially printed out a list with  times and stops that Number 6 will make. </p>
  <p> I need to get to the stop where the blue arrow is pointing. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170156.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In a moment we will pass by a big bus stop  followed by a right turn. </p>
  <p> I will be  getting off the cable car once it passes by this Lake   District.  </p>
  <p>Then I will walk  over to take the little train.  This is  it, the big bus stop.  </p>
  <p>All Poznan’s car probably  stops here as well.  Other than the big  bus stops like this one, there are smaller bus stops. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Look at the T-shirt the guy sitting in front  of me is wearing.  By the looks of it,  this is probably some Japanese anime.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170162.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  cable car stops at every stop; I counted 12 stops silently and then ready to  get off.  I am here!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once  the cable car stops, I have to press the button so the door will open.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170166.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A very clear sign.  It is ok even if I don’t understand the  words. </p>
  <p> Just by looking at the train  picture, I know I should follow the sign.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170167.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The little red roof in the front is where  tickets for the train are sold.  </p>
  <p>Right  when I arrived here, I heard the train’s whistle blowing, whoooo~</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170169.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And  then I saw the slowly moving train.  I  didn’t expect this easy to reach the train ticket station.  </p>
  <p>This means I am half way there.  I just have to get the train ticket now and I  will be there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Walking  to the ticket booth I was a little surprised.   </p>
  <p>Other than on the weekends, the train only runs once an hour.  </p>
  <p>Right now is 11:04am; the next train won’t come until noon.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170176.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When  I saw the train moving earlier, I should have run to it and ask it to wait for  me.  </p>
  <p>But I laughed foolishly thinking I  found the train station~! </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The old man selling the ticket said since  the train won’t come until noon,  </p>
  <p>he can’t sell me the ticket now.  But he gave  me a little guide to the train.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170177.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  total train rout is 3.55km (2.21miles).   There are only 2 stops, one is next to the lake, and the other one is  the zoo.  </p>
  <p>It looks like the zoo has been  around 30 years or so.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking  at the train’s brochure, it makes me even want to ride it.  </p>
  <p>The next train is the return train from the  zoo.  I will need to find something to do  for the next hour.  </p>
  <p>Good thing this is  very easy to do since there is a beautiful lake right here.  </p>
  <p>One hour isn’t enough for me to walk around.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  lake is very big, it is a natural lake.   </p>
  <p>There is a canal which leads water from this lake to another man-made  lake.  </p>
  <p>The man-make lake is the one I saw  when I had Indian food last time</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170184.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  is an extremely tall fountain on the Lake.  </p>
  <p>There aren’t a lot of clouds today, and very  lucky it isn’t raining.  </p>
  <p>The whole day  has been cool so I didn’t sweat from my walk.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  is a whole bunch of wild ducks next to the lake.  </p>
  <p>The ducks swim back and forth looking to see  whoever feeds them better tasting foods.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170192.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>That  is them, looks a lot like the duck and apple I had yesterday.  </p>
  <p>They are very skittish.  If anyone gets close to them, they  immediately fly into the lake.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  grass next to the lake is covered with feathers.  </p>
  <p>Anyone can feed the pigeons in the park and anyone  can feed the ducks next to the lake.   </p>
  <p>Even though the ducks are scared, but for food they will get close to humans.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170205.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Ducks  eat similar food to pigeons.  By taking a  loaf of bread and breaking it to parts, this can feed the ducks for  awhile.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They are feeding nuts here, the  ducks quickly left the old man over there and came over here. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170207.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  ducks are dumb.  By randomly taking some  leaves and nuts and threw them on the water,</p>
  <p> the ducks will come over and try  to eat it. </p>
  <p> Once the ducks found out they  have been fooled, they will quack and then swim away. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  are tons of ducks here.  The lake is  greenish in color, but the water quality is pretty good.  </p>
  <p>I can see the ducks’ legs busy moving and  swimming under the water.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170213.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  haven’t gone to the zoo yet, and I already feel like I have seen the zoo  already.  </p>
  <p>It is good I brought some  snacks along, or I would get hungry after looking at the ducks for so long. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  water fountain shooting with streams half-sky high up.  </p>
  <p>There are people rowing small boat on the  lake.  The boat quickly moves across the  lake.  </p>
  <p>There are tons of white clouds in  the sky.  I silently prayed there is no  rain in the afternoon. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170227.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are lots of grass growing along the  lake, reed, awn glass,etc that are particular to the lake.  </p>
  <p>However, there are no plants such as duckweed  and lotus plant.  The surface of the lake  is very clean.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170231.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because this lake is maintained so  beautifully, the rowing competition also takes place here.  </p>
  <p>Therefore the surface of the lake must be  kept clean so it wouldn’t affect the rowing competition.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170234.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It  takes at least 2 hours to walk once around the lake.  It wouldn’t take as long if I was biking or  roller blading.  </p>
  <p>There is a bike path, so  the mom pushing the baby stroller wouldn’t collide into each other. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170238.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is the pathway along the lake, very  long and straight. </p>
  <p> This one is for  people walking; there is another pathway just like this one for the bikers.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170242.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If I get tired from the walk, I can rest a  bit.  Looking at the beautiful lake, I am  tempted to jump down and swim.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170244.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  is a wonder no one is swimming in the lake even though there is a sign says no  swimming in the lake. </p>
  <p> Europe  has stricter laws.  </p>
  <p>If I am in Moscow, this lake would  become a camping site with a swimming pool already. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I walked a little bit more along the lake  and then I heard the whistle from the train.   </p>
  <p>The train has come back from the zoo.   </p>
  <p>I quickly run back to where the ticket booth for the train is at or I  will have to wait for another hour for the train.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170249.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Breathing heavily from my run, I saw there  is only one train running.  </p>
  <p>The mini  train head is green with the compartment in blue and white color.  </p>
  <p>In just a few minutes, the train is already  filled with people.  I quickly run to get  my ticket.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170257.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  zoo is very suitable for family to come, that is what most of the visitors are  made of as well.  </p>
  <p>The parents are here  with their kids or the grandparents taking the grandkids.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170258.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Seeing  a grandmother holding hands with a grandkid, I feel very warm inside.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  I arrived here this morning the train just left so the ticket booth area was  very empty.  </p>
  <p>Now there are lots of people  packed here in line waiting to purchase tickets.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170262.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  ticket isn’t expensive, $4.5 Zlit for adults single trip. </p>
  <p> I wasn’t sure if there is a discount for  round trip ticket.  Kids under 16 years  of age the ticket is $2.5 Zlit.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170266.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  train ticket is just a receipt, I hand the receipt to the train staff right  before I board the train.  </p>
  <p>He will stamp  a date on the back of the receipt.  This  means my ticket has been checked.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It  is a little troublesome looking at the small train.  The train is mostly filled already. </p>
  <p> So I ended up finding a small seat squished next  to this grandmother. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170267.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  train is a lot smaller than the cable car.   The seat of the car is very small, designed for the kids.  </p>
  <p>The adults behind has a difficult time  fitting into the seat.  </p>
  <p>People are  standing in the front compartment of this very crowded train.  </p>
  <p>At exactly noon, the train’s whistle went off, started in the  direction of the zoo. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking  at the train’s guide in the train; on the right side is the train  schedule.  </p>
  <p>Other than on the weekends,  the train leaves the lake area once an hour on the full hour dot, </p>
  <p>whereas the  train leaves the zoo area once an hour at the half hour dot.  The last train is at 7pm.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170271.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are other ways to get to the zoo than  taking the train since it is close by, such as walking, driving, or biking.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170279.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The train runs very slowly, 3.55km takes 15  minutes. </p>
  <p> On the way to the zoo, the  train kept passed by bikers.  </p>
  <p>The train  got to the zoo at the same time as this biking grandfather and granddaughter  pair.  </p>
  <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WIezfj9sIfw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Arrived at the zoo!  Time to get off~</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170286.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The grandfather in the picture above  already locked his bike up.  </p>
  <p>The tourist  here at the stop is the ones waiting for the return trip train from the zoo  back to the lake.  </p>
  <p>We are already in the  middle of the forest, a very small train station. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The guy in the dark green shirt is the conductor  for the train.  </p>
  <p>It is very amazing even  though the train head looks like a huge toy but it runs.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170289.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The driver seat of the train, which button  do I need to be pressed so that the train will blow its whistle?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170294.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I can either follow the people who just got  off the train or follow the signs for the zoo direction.  </p>
  <p>“DO ZOO” probably means This Way to the  Zoo.  After this hill should be the  entrance to the zoo.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170299.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are lots of people either in families  or as couples visiting the zoo.  </p>
  <p>Babies  also come here visit the zoo, they being pushed in their strollers.  </p>
  <p>Later when I see strollers in the zoo, they  contain little sleeping babies visiting the zoo.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170302.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even before I entered the zoo, I saw this  little shopping area contained with lot of animal related items. </p>
  <p> Some of them look really cute.  </p>
  <p>“Rolling on the ground back and forth, crying  if you don’t get me this”</p>
  <p> is something any kid around the world knows how to  use.  I saw that here as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170305.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The ticket booth and the entrance are  together, so once I got up the hill, I have to stand in line to get the  ticket.  </p>
  <p>The ticket prices for adults are  $9 Zlit, half price for kids, and babies are free.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170308.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The zoo ticket is the one with the lion  printed on it which says $9 Zlit.  </p>
  <p>The  zoo guide is the one with the big rhinoceros on it, which cost $5 Zlit.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170314.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  I got the zoo guide I realized it is written in Polish.  It is good the zoo guide has tons of  wonderful pictures in it. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This zoo is a little bit big, so if I walk  it will take awhile.  </p>
  <p>The animals have  lots of room to move around in their own exhibit.  </p>
  <p>But some of the animals only have small room  in their cages.  This includes an eagle  that needs room to fly.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170344.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  zoo has six large lakes, lots of bird species resting by the lake.  </p>
  <p>Because the zoo is so big, there is a train  service available inside the zoo.   </p>
  <p>However, I walked the whole day and didn’t see any sign of the  train.  </p>
  <p>This zoo doesn’t have a lot of  different animal species, but it seems like the animals all live very  comfortably here.  </p>
  <p>I hope the eagle does  get a new home one day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Everyone  runs toward here once they enter the zoo.   </p>
  <p>This usually means it is a petting zoo here where kids can touch the  animals.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170316.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are lots of animals made of wood  here.  </p>
  <p>If Misasa sees this elephant, she  probably would say, I want to ride, I want to ride.  </p>
  <p>And then sit here the whole day and not going  anywhere.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170319.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This hippo is also really cute.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170336.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A miniature pony and wagon.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170338.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  petting zoo contained mostly of goats, the kind that has 2 horns on their  head.  </p>
  <p>This is the kind of goat that  looks like the Poznan’s  pin badge where 2 goats have their head against each other.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170489.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170327.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Inside the fence there are new born goats  or kids and does that are pregnant. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170341.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  didn’t know kids are this cute, </p>
  <p>next time when I go eat hot pot I won’t order  kids to eat anymore, giving them some chance to grow up.  </p>
  <p>Human kids and goat kids together.  I laughed so hard after being here  awhile.  </p>
  <p>The human kids holding grass to  feed the goat kids, but once the goat kids came near the human kids,</p>
  <p> the human kids  got scared and run away. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170490.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then the goat kids runs over trying to eat  the grass.</p>
  <p>And then I see goat kids  chasing human kids with the human kids trying to hide from the goat kids.  </p>
  <p>The adults don’t go rescue the human kids;  rather they stand aside laughing and taking pictures.  </p>
  <p>Since it isn’t possible to be eaten by goat  kids, the human kids are here to learn how to interact with animals. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170492.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A sign about animals posted outside this  fence.  It shows the name, the habitat,  and a picture.  </p>
  <p>I am not sure what the  little caution sign with a panda in it on the upper left corner means.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170348.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Inside the zoo the path gets  confusing.  Other than the major  walkways, there are smaller paths in the zoo.   </p>
  <p>Looking at this sign means do not enter, this is meant for staff  entering certain zoo areas for the animals.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170349.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>An extremely big bird gate.  This reminds me of a bird cage scene in “The  Persian Prince – Sand in a Moment of Time.”   </p>
  <p>This area is big; I hear animal sounds all over not sure if the sound  came from inside or outside of the cage.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170351.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Maybe there are very many animals living  here already.  The area is planted with  lots of greeneries.  </p>
  <p>Other than the basic  fence that separate the human and the animals, the areas for the animals and  humans look the same.  </p>
  <p>There are no  special buildings built here, the zoo still contain the original forest look  for the animal habitat. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The bird leg is  already really skinny; they are probably tired from standing all the time.  </p>
  <p>When they sleep, they only stood with one leg;  wouldn’t they fall over in their sleep?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170364.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>

  <p>The animal habitat is very open, if I didn’t  see a sign posting what animals live here, </p>
  <p>sometimes I wouldn’t see any animals  at all.  </p>
  <p>I was wondering if this area is  filled with trees, but I saw some ladies kept taking pictures.  </p>
  <p>Then I follow their gaze I realized there are  giraffes here.  The areas they live in  are very spacious.</p>

  <p>Even though it is just a zoo here, the zoo  here seems very different.  </p>
  <p>When I see  the zoo here I feel excited, seems like I am looking at wild animals not an icy  cage holding bunch of lazy animals.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170370.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>One of the six lakes, the birds all freely roams  around the lakes. </p>
  <p> The birds are free to  leave in the winter time, if they want to come back is ok too.</p>

  <p>Swans~ Tons of ducks~ Pelicans and other  large birds</p>

  <p><img src="photo/P1170429.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I feel like I am hiking in the zoo,  breathing the clean fresh air in the forest, and looking at the animals became  second.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170390.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The zoo sits on 116 hectares (287 acres) of  land; it takes a long time to walk to see the whole zoo.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170398.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Very quickly I got separated from other  visitors that came from the same train ride as I did because the size of the  zoo is so big. </p>
  <p> It is a good thing I  still see other people here.  If I get  lost, I will just follow them. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Not sure  what this sign means, stop crossing area? No picking of the plants?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170399.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Here are separated by some wood fence.  Inside is a large area holding lots of  tigers.  </p>
  <p>This sign sets on the edge of  the exhibit.  Tiger is a fierce animal.  </p>
  <p>Accidents could still happen with visitors  running all around.  There is a small log  cabin to watch the tigers. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> For safety,  the visitors need to get up to the 2nd floor level, and look down to  find the tiger inside the forest habitat.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170413.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  is a picture of a tiger in the log cabin with sign on each of the tiger’s body  parts.  </p>
  <p>Walking closer and I saw that  each note notes that the tigers’ parts are being slaughtered, </p>
  <p>and then which  part is used for which medicine.  </p>
  <p>If we  don’t take care of the animals, those beautiful animals will become extinct.  </p>
  <p>Then we will only see those animals in  Chinese Medicine stores.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>New brush  branches growing out from the side of the tree that has been cut.  It becomes like this once it grows big.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170427.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Presenting  sleeping child.  No wonder the kids enter  for free because they are sleeping from the time they enter.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170433.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I didn’t see the train, but I did see the  train stop. </p>
  <p> I sat on the bench and rest  a bit.  The cool breeze blowing here  makes me sleepy.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170431.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The train’s route, looks like it is separated  into 3 sections.  How come I didn’t see  the train at all</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170459.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I sat on the bench napping, I got hit  by this on the head.  This area contains  monkeys.  </p>
  <p>If this didn’t fall from a  tree, then the monkeys threw this at me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170436.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>That is them, the smelly faced  monkeys.  They are from Japan.  </p>
  <p>When I look closer at the picture, I see the  monkey is holding a baby monkey.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170440.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Other than the wider walking path, I found  lots of smaller paths that can cut across the forest.  </p>
  <p>Those paths aren’t show on the map, I was a  little surprised when I found them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170451.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>A very attractive forest path, this is different  from the zoo I know.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170461.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In my memory, the zoos are covered with  tourist, lots of fences and exhibit buildings. </p>
  <p> Poznana’s zoo presents a feel of greenness and peacefulness. </p>
  <p> This stretch of green law houses deer and  birds.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On the bottom left corner of the  picture shows see some very low fence that isn’t very noticeable.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170465.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I wonder why those animals wouldn’t run out  of the fence.  </p>
  <p>Maybe the area inside the  fence is already very comfortable, similar to their natural habitat.  </p>
  <p>There is also food to eat, so there is no  reason to run away.  I saw a bigger deer  housed here. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The sign talks about the  type of deer, the one with antlers, and has spots on its body.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170473.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There are lots of species of deer here;  this one is probably a mixed deer.  I am  feeding it some snacks.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even though I  can not read Polish, I can still visit the animals I want by looking at the  signs.  </p>
  <p>The zoo has easy to understand  signs posted, they use pictures rather than words.  </p>
  <p>Thus I can tell by just one look at the sign  what types of animals are housed in this direction.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170477.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  map showing routes in blue or red color are suggested path for visiting the  zoo,</p>
  <p> this allows the visitors to visit more animals before having to walk too  much.  </p>
  <p>The black color route is the  longest visiting path; it is not possible to walk that route in less than two  hours. </p>
  <p> The only thing I didn’t get to  see on this trip is the African animals.   </p>
  <p>It is just too far away.  I sighed  looking at the map.  I don’t get tired riding  my bike but I got tried from the walk. </p>
  <p> This is the only restaurant in the zoo.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  things they sell are really simple, soda with burger, and French fries.  </p>
  <p>There is no price list, maybe the price kept  going up so they got lazy trying to change the sign all the time. </p>
  <p> Therefore they just decide not to have a  price list at all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170478.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  is good I brought a lot of water and snacks.   By the time I finish it all, is time to go back and take a nap.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  rode the train back to the lake area.   </p>
  <p>Then I took cable car #6 back to the dorm, basically the route I took in  reverse today.  </p>
  <p>Today is a travel blog on  the zoo.  If I put too many zoo animal  pictures up, it will feel cold.  </p>
  <p>Thus I  didn’t put too many zoo animal pictures up.   </p>
  <p>So I am putting up some pictures of beautiful girls. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170509.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The dinner today is made by Goose and  Guerilla.  </p>
  <p>Guys’ cooking isn’t any  shabbier than girls’ cooking.  </p>
  <p>When we  were in Hsinchu, I was the one cooking and Misasa was the assistant.  </p>
  <p>The kitchen in the dorm is pretty  convenient.  This way whatever is made is  much classier than Ramen Noodles.  </p>
  <p>Plus  the fact Goose and Guerilla are both foodies, so whatever we eat can’t be  anything bad.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170521.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Eating  so many varieties of food from different countries, </p>
  <p>I still feel that I prefer  food cooked by Taiwanese because they are homier.  </p>
  <p>A whole plate of ribs glazed with honey, Napa cabbage stewed with  chicken breast,</p>
  <p> light, sweet, and tasty long melons, and nutritious beef soup. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170525.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I ate bowl after bowls of white rice.  Home cooking is much more economical than  restaurant food. </p>
  <p> Not only I am very  happy to eat it, the interesting thing about cooking is its process.  </p>
  <p>Once I get back to Taiwan, I can cook again.  </p>
  <p>I have only been eating other people’s cooking;  I feel I want to cook as well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  am not sure other than boiling water to make Ramen Noodles, what else the portable  gas stove I am carrying can make?   </p>
  <p>Tomorrow is Thursday, the last day I plan to be in Poznana.  </p>
  <p>The only place I want to go to is to see  Mucha’s art exhibit, to feel a little bit of artistic feeling. </p>
  <p> I have to sleep well tonight so I can  continue forward to Paris. </p>
