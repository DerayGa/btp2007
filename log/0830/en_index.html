  <p class="style5">Mucha over a hundred years ago</p>
  <p>I had walked at lot while at the zoo  yesterday.  </p>
  <p>So today, other than going to  Mucha’s art exhibit later in the afternoon, </p>
  <p>I plan to stay in the dorm all  day.  </p>
  <p>Before I left for the art exhibit,  I planned out which route I need to take for the rest of the trip from Germany to Paris.  </p>
  <p>I decided I am not going to pass through Netherlands and  Belgium  this time.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In reality, I can still go  through those 2 countries, </p>
  <p>which adds 2 more countries to my list of the ones I  have already passed.  </p>
  <p>However, unlike Taiwan tourist  groups, which uses the number of passing by countries as an advertisement.  </p>
  <p>I feel quality is better than quantity.  Both Netherlands and Belgium are  beautiful countries. </p>
  <p> Riding my bike, I  can pass those countries in about 2-3 days.   </p>
  <p>But I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the  way.  </p>
  <p>Rather than passing by quickly this  time, I would rather take time on future trips to really enjoy those  countries.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the route I plan to  take:</p>
  <p><img src="photo/ge3.jpg" width="900" height="564" /></p>
  <p>I  plan to take 1-2 days to ride to the Poland and Germany border.  </p>
  <p>I won’t be going into Berlin because I would get lost in  there. </p>
  <p> I would ride in the southwest  direction, avoiding all freeways with the blue signs.  </p>
  <p>Maybe I will pass through Frankfurt  and enter France  right under Luxembourg.  </p>
  <p>Then I may go a little bit into the Alps, directly riding west into Paris.   </p>
  <p>That is, if everything goes the way I planned it.  I just have about 1300km (808 miles) left.  </p>
  <p>It is a lot less than the 2000km or so I had  thought.  </p>
  <p>This makes me wonder if there  is something wrong in my estimation. </p>
  <p> Even if I ride slowly the rest of the way, the trip would end in about 2  weeks. </p>
  <p> If no accidents happen, I should  be in Paris by  September 15th.</p>

  <p> If no accidents happen, I should  be in Paris by  September 15th.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before  I left for my trip, I had planned to stay in hotels once I enter Europe.  </p>
  <p>This is  because there are lots of hotels along the way.   </p>
  <p>There is no worry about safety, and the weather will also be nice.  </p>
  <p>However, due to trying to save money, it is  getting difficult to find places to camp for the night.  </p>
  <p>It doesn’t feel great to get kicked out of my  camping sites.  I am hoping this won’t  happen again. </p>
  <p> Also, it is getting into  September, so the temperature in Europe is  getting lower every day.  </p>
  <p>It is a good  thing I won’t be here during the winter time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  my afternoon meal I left for the art exhibit.   I feel a bit dizzy after being inside all day long.  </p>
  <p>There should be good weather for another  week.  </p>
  <p>I hope I can still get this good  weather all the way to Paris.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170529.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  walked a little to the castle where the exhibit was displayed at after taking  the cable car first.  </p>
  <p>The ticket at the  art exhibit only cost 10 ZLIT for students.   </p>
  <p>The exhibit is available from 11am  to 7pm.  Apparently Mucha is a very famous  artist.  </p>
  <p>I guess the reason I have never  heard of him is because my lack of knowledge. </p>
  <p>I feel very fortunate to be able  to see this artist’s work that is done over 100 years ago</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170533.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  seems like every country pronounces Mucha’s name differently.  </p>
  <p>I heard Musha, Muha, and Muka today.  </p>
  <p>It is strange his name is pronounced  differently, so I just use the original name, Mucha. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The display is inside the castle.  It is very elegant in there.  </p>
  <p>The bright lights and the overall  construction of the castle make the whole visit very comforting.  </p>
  <p>There aren’t a lot of people here, so I feel  even more comfortable looking at the exhibit.   </p>
  <p>This is the marble staircase inside the castle.  The exhibit is separate into 3 halls.  </p>
  <p>Before I enter each hall, the staff would  tear a little corner piece off my ticket.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170542.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mucha is a very famous artist from Moravia in the former  Austrian Empire.  </p>
  <p>He was born in the town  of Ivancice.  </p>
  <p>Most of his works are females, using  beautiful scenery as the background.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>His  brush strokes are very fine, the colors are soft.  </p>
  <p>With my untrained eye, when I first look at  his work I felt the pictures looks like female cartoon.  </p>
  <p>Then I feel the pictures look a bit like  Japanese anime, similar to this Japanese artist, Otomo Katsuhiro’s, work.  </p>
  <p>Most of Mucha’s work on display here are the  ones around 1900s, some even earlier than that. </p>
  <p> Even though the art works are over 100 years old, the paintings are  still very colorful.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170564.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Here is a picture of Mucha on the  wall.  </p>
  <p>After looking at his picture, I am  impressed with the fine details of his art work.  </p>
  <p>Here is Mucha’s self portrait.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/mucha67.jpg" width="546" height="782" /></p>
  <p>Entrance to the exhibit.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170571.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The entrance is covered with posters; this  artwork seems to be the main representative of Mucha’s work.  </p>
  <p>There are around 200 of his work on display  here. </p>
  <p> After looking at all his other  artworks, I feel there are other works that are worth seeing than this one.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170572.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Not  only does this picture shows Mucha’s style and specialty, </p>
  <p>his work sums up the  foundation of his work which I am very impressed with.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mucha not only painted, he also did  fresco.  </p>
  <p>Mucha also designed coins, pins,  posters for operas, </p>
  <p>menu for restaurants, and advertisement for hot chocolate.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/mucha78.jpg" width="425" height="782" /></p>
  <p>As expected, I can not take photos in the  exhibit.  </p>
  <p>Here is a link for the exhibit : <a href="http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mucha/mucha.html" target="_blank">http://www.abcgallery.com/M/mucha/mucha.html</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If  looking at the online photos isn’t enough, you can purchase Mucha’s art picture  album in large bookstores.  </p>
  <p>Really, I am  not very familiar with artwork so I have never heard of this great artist’s  name.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170575.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  exhibit store also sells some little things such as cards and calendars.  </p>
  <p>Because I wasn’t able to take photos in the  exhibit, I bought 3 bookmarks.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  the exhibit there is a large painting of the Red Square done in 1914 when Mucha  was in Moscow.  </p>
  <p>In the picture, I can see  the onion shaped domes of The Cathedral of St. Basil.  </p>
  <p>Back then, the Red   Square was a bazaar.  </p>
  <p>Since  I had just passed by Moscow,  I feel this picture is particular special.   </p>
  <p>I was able to stand at the same location 100 years later looking at the  same scenery,</p>
  <p> except now the peddlers became tourist taking photos.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/mucha91.jpg" width="700" height="495" /></p>
  <p>One thing about Mucha’s work is they are  all very large.  </p>
  <p>Very many of the art  pieces use large rectangular frames.   </p>
  <p>Then Mucha uses the canvas to draw even more beautiful frames.  </p>
  <p>This makes me feel that the character in the  art will pass through time and walk out at any moment.  </p>
  <p>Looking at those arts, it is hard to believe  they are done by hand.  </p>
  <p>The lines are  very fine, and the most impressive thing is the use of colors.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This gives life to the art work.  Here are some Mucha’s art posted for everyone  to enjoy.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  really like one of the arts done in 1886, Mucha was only 26 then.  </p>
  <p>In the picture there is a guy holding a girl  and kidding her forehead.  </p>
  <p>The girl was  startled and dropped the bird seeds in her hand all over the ground.  </p>
  <p>This particular picture doesn’t look like  Mucha’s other famous works with their beautiful color and design.  </p>
  <p>The characters don’t have the posture or the  beautiful face like the other pictures.   </p>
  <p>This small art piece is only 10 or so cm in length and width.  </p>
  <p>Yet this small piece touched me the most, I  can look at it for a long time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Too  bad the exhibit store doesn’t sell any item with this art on it. </p>
  <p> I am hoping I can find a picture album with  Mucha’s work in it so I can look at Mucha’s work any time I want to.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On  the way to the dorm, dark clouds started gathering again. </p>
  <p> It has been like this for several days.  During the night time it looks like it will  rain but during the day time it is very sunny.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170581.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  am leaving Poland  tomorrow.  I am hoping I will get some  good sunny weather.   </p>
