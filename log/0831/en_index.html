  <p class="style5">Good-Bye, Poland</p>
  <p>Just  a little past 7am, Goose  left for school.  I was just waking up  then.  </p>
  <p>I waved to him for good-bye.  </p>
  <p>Time for breaks goes by so fast; I felt I had  just arrived at Pozana yesterday afternoon with the sun setting behind me.  </p>
  <p>I am leaving Pozana early this morning; I am  a bit reluctant to leave.  </p>
  <p>I stayed here  for almost a week, there are a lot more places worth visiting that I haven’t  gone yet.  </p>
  <p>Poland also has other beautiful  cities worth visiting; hopefully I will get to come back later in the future.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170613.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Goose  posted a message for me on the door; it says </p>
  <p>“Deray, Have a safe trip.  Bye, Good Luck.” </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>When I turned the paper over, Goose wrote a  big “GO” on the back.  </p>
  <p>I have traveled  for more than 4 months now; I am beginning to miss my home. </p>
  <p> I want to go home now.  I am thinking about my semi-chaotic room, </p>
  <p>the  kitchen I can cook in, and the adorable Misasa. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> In one trip, I picked up and took all my stuff downstairs to the garage  Dido was parked.  </p>
  <p>I found a postcard from  Gorilla in the rear clamp of Dido.  </p>
  <p>If I  hadn’t met Gorilla and Goose at Poznan,  this trip would be a different story.  </p>
  <p>I  probably wouldn’t have stopped at Poznan.  </p>
  <p>I would still be riding Dido somewhere else  with Dido’s bike chain going kalakala.   </p>
  <p>Thank you for your help, and thank you for your hospitality.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170619.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I noticed the huge layers of clouds as soon  as I walked out of the dormitory door.   </p>
  <p>The sky is also dark and windy.  I  do not feel good about this.                      </p>
  <p>Goose and Guerilla both  said it will rain today.  </p>
  <p>The weather  report said it will rain around noon.  </p>
  <p>I am hoping as long as I leave the rain storm  area in Poznan  before noon, </p>
  <p>I will be  fine.  Please give me a chance to get out  of this rain cloud area! </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Zip  tie is so convenient and easy to use. </p>
  <p> I  used zip ties to strap up the broken support bar that is holding up the back  knapsack.  </p>
  <p>This way, I can put the laptop  back into the back knapsack.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170621.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  only managed to carry the laptop on top of the front bag for one day without  any accidents.  </p>
  <p>Now with the laptop back  in the back knapsack, </p>
  <p>I don’t have to worry about the laptop flying off when it  was on top of the front bag.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I left a  little before 9am.  </p>
  <p>So if the weather report is correct, I still  got 3 hours to get out of the Poznan  area before the storm hits.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170623.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>First,  I need to look for the connecting road to get out of the city.  </p>
  <p>When I was studying the map yesterday, I  found if I follow Red 92 way,</p>
  <p> I can get to the Poland/Germany border.  The distance is about 190km (118 miles).  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This sign showing a little boy with his hat  and backpack is different from the previous sign of a little girl</p>
  <p> in braids  holding a red balloon.  Those signs mean  be aware of children crossing; they are all very adorable signs.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170624.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  has started to rain, although very little rain has came down.  </p>
  <p>It is still some time until noon, those rain started early.  I was still in Poznan trying to figure out the road signs.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170626.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Left?  Right?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  I found the correct connecting roads, the rain poured down.  </p>
  <p>I got soaked immediately.  The rain came so fast; there was no place to  hide.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170631.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Finally  there is a place under the bride where I can hide from the rain a bit.  </p>
  <p>The rain doesn’t look like it will stop  anytime soon so I put the waterproof covers onto the knapsacks.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  will have to ride in the rain.  It is  uphill right here, so all the water flows down here collecting into huge  puddles.  </p>
  <p>The trucks passing by me drove  so fast and splashed me all over with dirty water from the rain.  </p>
  <p>I left wearing clean and dry clothing.  In one hour, I managed to be dirty  again.  </p>
  <p>My shoes and socks got wet as  well, so I will be riding with my slippers on.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  left while it was still raining but the rain fall slowed down a bit soon  after.  </p>
  <p>After I have been looking at the  signs for awhile, </p>
  <p>I understand that the white circle with the black letters PL  and D means the border of Poland  and Germany.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170632.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Right  now I am still 169km (105 miles) from Poland and Germany  border.  </p>
  <p>I am about 276km (172miles) from  Berlin, Germany’s capitol city.  </p>
  <p>Because of the rain and the wind is blowing  against me, it is difficult to ride all the way to the border in one day.  </p>
  <p>So whatever distance I ride today will be  it.  I will ride the rest tomorrow to get  to Germany.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  clouds are so low to the ground.  There  is only a little bit distance between the field and the sky.  </p>
  <p>The highest temperature it got today is 16C  (60F), so it was a bit cold today.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170634.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>My  whole body shakes from being drenched in the rain and the wind blowing against  me.  </p>
  <p>I stopped and moved around a bit to  warm up.  </p>
  <p>I put some pop music on before  I started up again so I won’t be as cold.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It  feels like the trees are saying goodbye to me on the road leaving Poznana.  </p>
  <p>Because the colder fall season is coming, if  I plan to camp again I will have to take out the sleeping bag for warmth.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170635.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I didn’t even ride 40km (25mile) when noon rolled around.  </p>
  <p>But I left Poznan already; I no longer see signs going  into or out of Poznana.  </p>
  <p>There isn’t a  lot of food in my bags, my stomach is also empty, and it is time to buy some more  food.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170637.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  bought a huge loaf of bread and 4 different flavors of cookies at this country  store.  </p>
  <p>I told myself to eat half loaf of  bread first before I started up on the cookies.   </p>
  <p>It is more important to fill the stomach first.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170639.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Great, the more I ride to the west, the  weather looks better.  </p>
  <p>There are still a  lot of clouds in the sky, but the color is no longer black.  </p>
  <p>The clouds are now white, and I can see some  blue skies as well.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170644.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>As  soon as the waterproof covers dried up, I took them off the knapsacks.  </p>
  <p>Now the bags will be drying in the cold  blowing wind.  </p>
  <p>The clothing I was wearing  already dried up from the ride.  </p>
  <p>The only  place I see any evidence of rain was the ones on my glasses.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  didn’t sweat any today because the cool weather is a little bit too cold.  </p>
  <p>Too bad the clothing already got drenched  with dirty water from passing by trucks, </p>
  <p>or I would be completely clean from  today’s ride.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The closer to the border,  the livelier it becomes.  </p>
  <p>There are also  money exchange, rest area, hotel, restaurant, gas stations along the way.  </p>
  <p>No wonder it is the road going into Europe.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170646.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Once  I leave Poland,  I will be using Euros.  </p>
  <p>There are lots of  24 hour money exchange places along the way.   </p>
  <p>The sign Kantor means money exchange.   The money exchange rate here isn’t as good as the ones in Poznan city.  </p>
  <p>But the number of stores increases as I get  closer to the border. </p>
  <p> It is about time  to spend some Euros. </p>
  <p> I hope I don’t try  to figure out the Euro to NTW conversion every time I spend money.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Otherwise,  I wouldn’t buy or eat anything.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I got  very sleepy around 1:30pm.  </p>
  <p>This is probably due to riding in the rain  and the fact I didn’t get to bed until 2am  last night.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170656.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  was half asleep by the time I reached this bus stop.  </p>
  <p>It is very dangerous to ride while my mind can’t  distinguish between dream and reality at this point.  </p>
  <p>It is very stupid to fall off the bike from sleeping  or hitting by a car.  </p>
  <p>So I kept looking  for a place to stop.  I was very excited  when I found this bus stop.  </p>
  <p>The nearly  enclosed place provides warmth.  I lay  flat on the bench and took something to be my pillow.  </p>
  <p>I was asleep within seconds.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  slept here for an hour and half.  I  finally felt a lot better.  </p>
  <p>The sky  darkened when I got up and rode again.  I  really miss the bright sunlight.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Other  than money exchange places along the road, there are tons of places selling  wood windmill and stone carving.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170660.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170662.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are bunch of stone carved chicken, sheep, pork, </p>
  <p>and cow on the grass along with  wood made items with no price tag on them.   </p>
  <p>However, I wouldn’t buy any anyway.   The dark cloud covered area stops here.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is very clear where the dark cloud ends and bright sky starts.  </p>
  <p>Once I pass this hill, the sky won’t be so  dark anymore.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170665.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  got a little frightened right here by the sign that says be careful of crazy  cow.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170671.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Don’t  get blind sighted, the cows are made of cardboard so is the sign that says be  careful of crazy cows.  </p>
  <p>Those signs are  advertisement for this beer company.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  2 stars hotel looks very comfortable, shouldn’t be very expensive either.  </p>
  <p>After all, I am still in Poland, nothing  can compare to the high prices in Europe.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170672.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  longer I travel the less chance I get to stay in a hotel.  </p>
  <p>I once would have considered this hotel being  one of my sleeping places.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But  now I continue peddling along looking for my real sleeping spot.  </p>
  <p>The trees all stand up straight in one  row.  This feels like Poland doesn’t  want me to leave.  </p>
  <p>I stayed so long in Poland, and  always had nice sunshine days.  </p>
  <p>The  moment I try to leave, the sky rains and the wind blows.  Don’t keep me here!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170673.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  restaurant sign looks like the restaurant has lots of delicious food.  </p>
  <p>The sign also says it takes Euro and money  exchange service.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170677.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  money exchange rates don’t look very good from most places along the road, this  one included. </p>
  <p> I guess it is easy to get  money exchange business along this road so there is no reason </p>
  <p>for the stores to  compete with one another on the exchange rates. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I was curious so I went in to see what money exchange place looks  like. </p>
  <p> In addition to Euro exchange, they  also offer exchanges for East Europe  countries.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170681.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  still got enough ZLIT on me.  </p>
  <p>I will have  to exchange USD for Euro later on with not so favorable exchange rates.  </p>
  <p>I plan to get to Paris in 10 days.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Unless  there are any accidents, I don’t plan to stay in a hotel for the rest of the  trip.  </p>
  <p>My small hope is to have a big  meal, but I will have to see how much money I have got then.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Around  6pm, I finally stopped at a  big gas station.  </p>
  <p>There are very few lone  gas stations along the way.  Most gas  stations are included in a rest area.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170686.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even though it doesn’t look very impressive  from the outside, this store carries lots of items including gas. </p>
  <p> I am not sure which gas is used for vaporized  gas stove.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170688.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  didn’t have any extra plastic bottles with me, and the price of gas is really  expensive.  </p>
  <p>For 1 L (0.26 gallon) of gas  it costs $50NT ($1.56USD).  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is a  huge restaurant in the gas station with lot of people in there. </p>
  <p> There are also electronic games in the gas  station. </p>
  <p> I am very impressed with how  prosper and civilized Europe is.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170690.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  took my water bottle to the bathroom planning to get some water and to wash my face;  </p>
  <p>even the bathroom has tons of stuff.   </p>
  <p>There is washer, dryer, and shower service in the bathroom paid by  whoever uses the service.  </p>
  <p>The gas  station is 24 hour service.  So it would  be easy to find a spot to sit and spend the night here.  </p>
  <p>There is heating in the building and free  charging for electricity.  </p>
  <p>This means as  long as I can figure out where to put the bike, I can stay in any of the gas  stations.  </p>
  <p>I want to get closer to the  border before the sun goes down.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That  way, I wouldn’t have to ride as far tomorrow.   </p>
  <p>Since Poland  is also in the European Union, maybe it wouldn’t be so complicated to get into Germany from Poland. </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>I found this empty house around 8pm.   </p>
  <p>There is some damage to the outside, but the roof is still there.  </p>
  <p>Even if the weather gets bad at night, I  still got a roof over my head protecting me from the rain and the wind.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170695.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The wall is covered with vine, there is  also tire tracks near the door.  </p>
  <p>It feels  like no one will come here, but I still check out the area before making my  decision about staying here.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170702.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When  I opened the first door, the space is small like the size of a wine  cellar.  </p>
  <p>It contains a wood table and 2  twin sized mattress. </p>
  <p> If I sleep here, I  would be able to sleep on top of a mattress tonight.  </p>
  <p>It looks like the perfect stop, but something  doesn’t feel right about this place.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  feels like the scene of a scary movie.   There is another little room next to this one.  </p>
  <p>I was shocked when I opened the 2nd  little room door, there is a pair of clean white canvas sneakers.  </p>
  <p>How come there are clean canvas shoes  here?  </p>
  <p>This doesn’t make sense with the  surrounding area.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My  brain started making up stories… once there is a traveler who stopped here to  camp.  </p>
  <p>At the middle of the night someone  came to kidnap him including his luggage.   </p>
  <p>The only thing left here is his clean sneakers.  </p>
  <p>I was pretty impressed with my own  imagination, but I also left here quickly. </p>
  <p> It felt like I just got away from some horrible disaster.  I continue riding toward the west.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It  is very rare to see empty houses along this route. </p>
  <p>I reached another rest area in about half of  an hour.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170713.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>With the sky getting darker, neon lights  from the stores shine through them.  </p>
  <p>The  24 hour signs and lights attract me.  I  just have to look at the lights to get a warm feeling. </p>
  <p> Leading Dido along the huge glass window, I  see people enjoying their dinner in the warm yellow lights.  </p>
  <p>I get hungry by just looking at them.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I circled around the building to get an idea  what this place is like.  </p>
  <p>I plan to find  a place here to sleep tonight since this is a 24 hour establishment; </p>
  <p>the chance  of me getting kicked out is slim.  </p>
  <p>The  parking lot has tons of 18 wheelers parked there.  </p>
  <p>The gas station is also pretty big.  In comparison, this little hut seems very  small even though it is pretty big.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170716.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  is clean floor and furniture in the hut.   </p>
  <p>Other than me, no one comes near the hut. </p>
  <p> Everyone goes straight to the restaurant  right after they get out of their car and vice versa.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1170721.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  slept on the floor of this hut for free tonight.  </p>
  <p>I was completely out by 9pm.  It  was pretty cold during the day, and at night time the temperature definitely  dropped a lot.  </p>
  <p>I am lucky I have my tent  and sleeping bag keeping me warm. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I  slept in front of Dido’s front wheel.   </p>
  <p>Dido leaned against the fence part of the hut.  </p>
  <p>This is my last night in Poland.  In previous passing countries I got lots of  help from the locals. </p>
  <p> By the time I  reached Poland,  I got help from Taiwanese people who is studying here.  </p>
  <p>To Goose, Gorilla, and everyone studying  hard, </p>
  <p>thanks for your help the last few days, and I hope everyone can finish  their studies soon and be back to Taiwan. </p>
