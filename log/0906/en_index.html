  <p class="style5">Peter’s Home</p>
  <p>By  the time I moved everything up to the second floor and placed everything for  the night,</p>
  <p> I found there is a window that leads to the street,and the window  doesn’t have any glass on it.  </p>
  <p>This means  if there is someone that comes in here in the middle of the night, they can  easily get into this house. </p>
  <p> For safety  reason, I purposely found some wood sticks and blocks off the window.  </p>
  <p>So if someone comes in they will hit those  wood sticks, and wakes me up from my sleep.   </p>
  <p>The safety procedure is just in case, good thing the whole night was  fine, slept until morning. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180576.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Outside  ground is a bit wet; maybe there is some rain last night.  </p>
  <p>By the time the sun came up today, it had  stopped raining, and seems like the weather today is much better than the last  few days.  </p>
  <p>Since I can get out from the  second floor, there is no need to move the bike to the downstairs area. </p>
  <p> I can get out from the 2nd floor window;  just one trip takes care of it all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180577.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When  I left this empty house, walking to the quiet neighborhood, it was still very  quiet around 7:30am, </p>
  <p>very few pedestrians and cars on the road. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180579.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  first thing I did wasn’t tried to ride more, but go back to the grocery store  from last night.  </p>
  <p>There is a free  electric plug next to the cart area; I need to finish writing the travel  journal today before I leave. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180580.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  getting into different countries, the places I write travel journals change as  well,</p>
  <p> from the hotel bed to the tables at the restaurant, </p>
  <p>and now I am sitting  on the ground in front of a grocery store typing away. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I still have half load of bread and half  package of cookies left from yesterday, </p>
  <p>I am eating those things for breakfast  while I write the travel journal. </p>
  <p> The  more I eat, the thirstier I get, but I don’t have any water I can drink. </p>
  <p> The water in the water bottle tastes funny;  so I can only use it to wipe my face, </p>
  <p>I don’t want to drink this water  regardless how thirsty I am. </p>
  <p> Since it is  the grocery store next door, then I can buy some beverages, it has been awhile  since I spent money to buy beverages. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180581.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  comparing prices for a while, I found regardless which country, </p>
  <p>they all have  similar things to Coca Cola, and the prices are cheap as well.  </p>
  <p>This is the same in Germany, 1.5L (6.3 cups) of soda just $0.39 Euro  ($0.60USD), </p>
  <p>so even if in China money (RMB), this is still very cheap. </p>
  <p> I picked out a bottle each of cola and orange  soda, I calculated two bottles being $0.78Euro ($1.17USD), </p>
  <p>but when I checked  out the cashier charged me $1.28Euro ($1.92USD). </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180583.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Very  confusingly I paid for the sodas, and then looking at the receipt to see why  they charge me $0.50Euro more ($0.75USD).   </p>
  <p>And really, the store does show each bottle is $0.39 Euro, </p>
  <p>but every  bottle I bought on the receipt it shows a fee for “EW-PFAND 1-ER” which costs  $0.25Euro.  </p>
  <p>I didn’t buy this item, so  why is this item on the receipt?  </p>
  <p>This is  not possible for shopping bag charge either because I didn’t get a shopping  bag.  </p>
  <p>The more I thought the weirder it  gets, the only ting I can think of is purchasing single bottle is more  expensive.  </p>
  <p>I explained to myself that at  the store each bottle is $0.39Euro, and the bottle is in a pack of four,</p>
  <p> so it  is ok to buy just one bottle, except when you buy just one bottle it is $0.25  Euro more. </p>
  <p> This sounds like some random  excuse, like I just got fooled, then I wasted all that time comparing prices  inside, </p>
  <p>for $0.39Euro plus the $0.25Euro fee, this is not cheaper than any  other soda.  </p>
  <p> (Note: the $0.25Euro is for bottle deposit fee, or commonly called  recycle fee). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking  at this receipt for a while, twisting open the soda cap, drinking the cola and  eating my toast for breakfast.  </p>
  <p>I am just  1/3 done with the travel blog, there are lots more to write.  </p>
  <p>Sitting in front of the store to write the  travel blog, it is getting toward noon, </p>
  <p>and there are more people coming to  shop, but no one is taking an interest to me. </p>
  <p> As long as the store workers don’t kick me away, I don’t mind anyone  watching me. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  the early morning the sun came out, I got warm in the sun, I regret why I didn’t  try to ride then,</p>
  <p> and spend this time to write the travel blogs.  </p>
  <p>I didn’t leave until 11am in the morning, so  if I am trying to ride more lately, </p>
  <p>then I will wait to write the travel blogs  when I get to Paris, I am putting my traveling first.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By  the time I left, the sun has disappeared again, the sky has turned dark, and  very foggy inside the mountain, I am not sure if it is raining or foggy. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180587.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> After leaving the store for 5km, I saw a gas station.  </p>
  <p>Out of habit I will ride around the gas  station for a bit, but the bathroom here cost money, so I can’t get water to  drink.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180588.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Although  the bathroom cost money, but the gas station provides free Internet connection,  I found another place to get online.   </p>
  <p>Through the window I see there is electric plug-in inside but no plug-in  outside. </p>
  <p> Since I don’t have electricity  backup, I quickly updated my travel blogs online. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180589.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Good  thing there is no plug-in and Internet, otherwise I wouldn’t ride at all  today. </p>
  <p> I already spent this morning  sitting in front of the store writing travel blogs, </p>
  <p>and I would likely to spend  the whole afternoon here at the gas station getting on the Internet.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I left the gas station the weather didn’t  change much, after riding into the mountain, </p>
  <p>I found those white clouds, it is  a mix of fog and freezing rainwater.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180592.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  weather is a bit strange, normally for September, Germany should be warm, no  reason to be so cold right now.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I  purchased soda this morning I was only thinking of comparing prices, I didn’t  consider any health information. </p>
  <p>Looking  at the cow eating grass, I thought I should have bought some milk to drink for  health reasons. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180594.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  I saw bike only path, it would be good to ride on them even though the normal  road doesn’t prohibit bikes,</p>
  <p> but it feels better to ride on bike only road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180596.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are few special things about the bikes only road in Germany: </p>
  <p>First, you can see  bikes only path anywhere, regardless whether in cities or country side, </p>
  <p>the  rights of the cyclist is regarded special in Germany.  </p>
  <p>Second, they are beautiful; the people who  plan bike paths are genius,</p>
  <p> not only are the bike path follows the normal road,  and are flat, but the views are also beautiful.   </p>
  <p>Third, very ridiculous, a lot of time when I ride half way the bike path  will disappear, </p>
  <p>and end up in the field.   At first I think it is funny, then I got used to it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180631.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because  the bike path are unique and special, sometimes I am not sure if I am lost or  if I am touring the fields. </p>
  <p> In  situations like this, I need to see if there are signs that say whether this is  a bike lane.  </p>
  <p>As long as there is a bike  lane sign, then it means the road was designed like this, </p>
  <p>the betters ones will  even show distance to the next place and where it is going.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180607.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  didn’t start riding until around noon today, so I wasn’t sure how far I could  ride today.  </p>
  <p>But I just hope I can ride  as much as I can today, I shouldn’t have taking lots of nice riding time to  write the travel journals. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180597.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When  I entered this town I was a bit in shock, all the streets have X marks over  them.  </p>
  <p>What is it then?  Is the street ahead completely gone?  </p>
  <p>My goal today is Wurzburg; it is also one of  the places that got an X mark over it.   </p>
  <p>Since the street marker say I can’t get there, then I will just enter  this city and trying to find other paths I can take.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180598.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  stone paved road is very pretty and elegant, although it isn’t made for bicycle  to ride over. </p>
  <p> If riding on the  pedestrian path on the side, then I need to be careful not running into store  signs or displays.  </p>
  <p>After crossing through  this town I found the correct road, and the sky is clearing up as well.  </p>
  <p>Looking at the dark clouds disappearing is a  great feeling. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180624.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even  though all the temperatures are around 10C, but under the cloudy sky I feel colder.  </p>
  <p>Once seeing the bright blue sky then I feel  the weather is no longer cold, but cool. </p>
  <p> I saw lots of signs along the road; it is difficult to understand the  meaning.  </p>
  <p>Does the number represent speed  limit?  Then what does the tank in the  sign means?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180616.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some  stone carving on the bridge, in Europe you can see art pieces anywhere.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180605.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Comparing  to Poland, going toward southwest in Germany,</p>
  <p> most of the places are farm  fields, and the towns I meet are smaller in size, I have only gotten lost in  one major city in Germany.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I finished al  my food in the morning, right now I only have 2 small packages of candy in my  bag, </p>
  <p>I ate everything I can possibly eat this morning.  </p>
  <p>Around 3pm, my stomach grumbled, it is no  help eating candy,</p>
  <p> so I better going to the grocery store to buy some food with  substance. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180612.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  is very easy to find grocery stores in Germany, almost as easy to find as gas  stations. </p>
  <p> Although there is a very weird  rule, you cannot take pictures in the grocery store.  </p>
  <p>Just because I took the above photo, there  were 3 store clerks following me around until I left the store. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180614.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  purchased 2 loafs of toast here.  Right  now I am hungry enough to finish a loaf of bread without any butter or jam,</p>
  <p> slice after slice, until I am not hungry anymore.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are few places I stops by now, such as  the grocery store where I buy my food, and McDonald where I get water. </p>
  <p> Finally there are the gas station, where I  can usually find wireless Internet, and high likely chance to find electric  plug-ins,</p>
  <p> and my very new discovery, the air pump machine.  With the air pump machine, </p>
  <p>I can now easily  keep the tire in the fullest possible, this way it is easier to ride. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180628.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It is very easy to use, put the piece in,  and press on the “+” button, and look at the air pressure machine,</p>
  <p> and wait  until the tire pressure reaches 60.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While pumping air into the tire I can also charge batteries, resting  here, no need to get gas just get air. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180630.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Other than not going into restaurants and  hotels, there is also another change. </p>
  <p>The clothing I am wearing go from light to thicker ones,</p>
  <p> if I feel hot  then I take the clothing off and put it on the bike, there is another  sleeveless shirt inside.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Around 5pm in  the afternoon, I will take off the shoes and socks, and ride with the  slippers.  </p>
  <p>This way I will allow the feet  to air out for 3 hours, </p>
  <p>so when I sleep in the nighttime I won’t sleep with  stinky feet inside the tent. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The shoes I  took off I tie it on the bag in front of the bike. </p>
  <p> If I tie the shoes on the back of the bike,  then there is possibility the shoes will get lost while riding somewhere.  </p>
  <p>Today is a very simple day, at least until  now. </p>
  <p> I didn’t leave until around noon,  still living in Germany’s time zone, not much change.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180635.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Having  a simple day is a good thing too, as long as there is no accident  happening. </p>
  <p> Having a great weather like  this riding in such beautiful country is a pleasure.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Soon the sun will go down again, there is  some problem though. </p>
  <p> One thing is there  is nothing to report for the travel journal, another is I didn’t ride very far  today, just barely passed the 100km  (62 miles) mark.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180641.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This way I will need to hurry up if I want  to reach Paris by September 12 at noon, </p>
  <p>unless the rest of the road are all  flat and easy to ride.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Also, it would  help if I stop getting lost, and don’t spend so much day light time writing the  travel journals. </p>
  <p> After eating the toast  for a whole day combined with weird soda, I feel I don’t have enough  calories. </p>
  <p> I feel like I don’t have  enough energy riding the bike, and before the store closed I went in to purchase  5 packs of chocolates.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180642.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  stores in Germany  closes around 8pm every night, I have not seen a 24-hour store yet.  </p>
  <p>After purchasing this pack of chocolate, I  broke the amount I set up that I can spend today. </p>
  <p> I will pretend I borrow money from tomorrow,  since there is still a loaf of bread here,</p>
  <p> and chocolates will add calories  fast, it is a very important snack for riding the bike. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> After purchasing the chocolate, there are  still 30 minutes left for me to ride the bike, </p>
  <p>just 30km (19miles) less than my goal today, but I probably  won’t reach it today. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180644.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On  the right side of the road is railroad track, and on the right of the track is  a big river.  </p>
  <p>On the right of the river  is bike only lane, but I don’t know how to get there. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>During  the day when I ride the bike, the car drivers will pass around me. </p>
  <p> After the sun goes down, I will turn on the  red flashlight, and turn on the bike headlights as well.  </p>
  <p>I don’t know why, but after the sun goes  down, the drivers like to honk their horn. </p>
  <p> I know they are honking at me, are they warning me?  Or telling me not to ride on the streets in  the dark? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  do not feel good getting honked all the time, especially during the day I am  respected.  </p>
  <p>So I turn to Side Street,  while there is some light out it is time to find a place to rest for tonight. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180645.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Looking  at how I have camped the last few days, bus stop, empty house, bus stop again,  followed by empty house again,</p>
  <p> then I should find a bus stop to sleep for  tonight.  </p>
  <p>After turning into this small  town I started looking for bus stops, but I only found bus stop markings, there  is no “rest place”.  </p>
  <p>However, it will not  be good choice going back to the street to ride further.  </p>
  <p>Right when I was wondering what to do, I saw  a guy running on this cold evening.  </p>
  <p>He  stopped in front of me and breathed a big sigh. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At  first he started talking to me in German, then found I couldn’t understand so  he talked to me in English.  </p>
  <p>This is  surprising since his English is great.   In European countries, only the young ones have excellent English. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  older ones know several languages, but do not speak English.  </p>
  <p>I told him I am traveling through on my bike,  trying to find a place to rest tonight.   </p>
  <p>Is there some type of park or bus stop around here?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He suggested a learning/activity center in  this town, they provide housing, and it is cheap as well.  </p>
  <p>He said he can ask for me, and maybe I can go  there for free.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>FREE?  I wasn’t expecting much, but the guy told me  to follow him. </p>
  <p> He was running ahead I  followed behind with the bike.  </p>
  <p>But I was  still eyeing for another place to sleep tonight.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180647.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  took about 10 minutes to get there, and since he knows English we were able to chitchat. </p>
  <p> I found out when he was younger he worked in  an American military base.  </p>
  <p>He also  played lots of ping-pong with the soldiers, so his speaks English well.  </p>
  <p>We kept talking but we forgot to tell each  other our own names.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Peter,  that is what he said his name is, not only is his English well, but his name is  also very English. </p>
  <p> Every time when  someone asks me how many days I have been traveling?  </p>
  <p>I answer 130+ days, the other person will  show this unbelievable look;</p>
  <p> really, I can’t believe I have been traveling so  long either.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Running to the end of the  street, it was a completely dark house, Peter looked at the sign outside saying  the place is closed, </p>
  <p>so there was no chance to ask if I can possibly get free  lodging. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180648.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So  I asked the same question again, is there any place to camp?  </p>
  <p>As long as I won’t get kicked out in the  middle of the night.  </p>
  <p>Peter say, follow  him, he has a garage for me to sleep in.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180651.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Peter  runs about 10km every  night, because he needed to take me to the learning/activity center, so he runs  extra today. </p>
  <p> Peter seems really tired by  now.  Turns out we passed by his home  earlier, but he didn’t stop. </p>
  <p> He still  took me to the learning center, and now just came back.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Peter  went up to get the key, I waited by the garage downstairs, </p>
  <p>it has gone  completely dark already, and the temperature keeps dropping.  </p>
  <p>When I was chatting with Peter earlier he  said the temperature has been weird.   </p>
  <p>Usually around this time of the year the temperature is still warm, but  not sure what happened this year, </p>
  <p>some places has already started snowing, and  it was only September! </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is Peter’s home.  It is great to live in Europe;  you can purchase individual houses, </p>
  <p>no need to live with strangers in the same  building complex like a bird in a cage.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180652.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Three  minutes later Peter came back and opened up the garage door, it is wonderful  being able to sleep indoor tonight.  </p>
  <p>This  breaks the empty house and bus stop cycle.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  In order for me to sleep comfortably, Peter  even moved the car out, making a bigger space for me to sleep.  </p>
  <p>Even though I kept saying, no need to trouble  you, this is fine already.  </p>
  <p>But Peter  insisted the car wouldn’t complain spending the night outside is cold, so no  need to be nice. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  taking the bike in, I unloaded luggage and opened up the tent. </p>
  <p> I told Peter I would leave first thing  tomorrow; I will not trouble him.  </p>
  <p>But  Peter did not think I am any trouble, after I put the bike into the garage, </p>
  <p>he  asked me if I want anything to eat, how about some red wine?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  opened up the plastic bag on the bike handle, took out an unopened bag of  toast, I said I would eat this today,</p>
  <p> I am grateful I can sleep in the garage  tonight. </p>
  <p> Peter looking at the toast and  said leave this for tomorrow, and follow him upstairs for some warm food to  eat. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>No  need to trouble I said.  </p>
  <p>No trouble from  Peter.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180662.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Living  with Peter is his wife, Ulrike, even with me the complete stranger, both  welcome my visit.  </p>
  <p>Sitting on the kitchen  chair, Peter poured out a glass of red wine for me,</p>
  <p> French wine, it is nice  able to drink some wine to warm myself up in a cold night like this.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180654.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Ulrike  used the oven to bake a pizza, and then took out a map. </p>
  <p> Looking at this satellite map without country  line, no place names, and no street, I found I have rode very far.  </p>
  <p>Pointing to Taiwan, I said I live here, and  then point to Beijing, I said I started here. </p>
  <p> Then crossing Europe, I am almost at Paris. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180656.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Taking  out the camera, playing the photos inside, I said I am lucky the tourist let me  look at their map, </p>
  <p>and letting me taking a picture of the map for reference, so  I can ride all the way to here.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then  Peter took out a more detailed map of Germany, and then I started to study the  route and taking picture. </p>
  <p> It is very  precious able to see a real map made with paper.  </p>
  <p>After taking so many pictures, Peter said no trouble;  he will give me this map. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I can take  this all the way to Paris and be fine. </p>
  <p> Just like this I received a real map, detailed and free, the kind that  is like a book, </p>
  <p>not the kind you have to open up a big piece of paper, very  easy to turn and not likely to torn.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After the pizza is done baking, it wasn’t placed on the kitchen table,  but to the dining room table. </p>
  <p> I already  feel blessed having a warm pizza to eat, but the dining room table has even  more stuff. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180667.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  whole pizza for me, and mozzarella cheese with tomato drizzled in extra virgin  olive oil and basil;</p>
  <p> I think this dish tastes great every time I eat it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180669.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And  another type of cheese, with the addition of spices and minced onion, very  delicious. </p>
  <p>There are three types of  cheese on the table, all are produce of France. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180673.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And there is preserved radish, with the  addition of hot spices from Turkey.  The  combination is great.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180675.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Glass  after glass of red wine, sitting with Peter and Ulrike enjoying the wonderful  meal.  </p>
  <p>Fate is an interesting thing,  meeting Peter during his run, </p>
  <p>and then invited to his house for a full dinner,  it is all beyond expectation. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> And 30  minutes ago I was still searching for a bus stop to sleep in the dark. </p>
  <p> When I was eating I found I was missing one  slipper.  Peter has a cat and a dog in  the house.  </p>
  <p>The dog likes to chew up  stuff, the dog has already chewed up half dozen worth of shoes.  </p>
  <p>Regardless how many chew toys or bones they  purchase, the dog just likes to chew shoes, maybe because of smell. </p>
  <p> In just one moment, the dog almost chewed the  blue and white slipper up.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180699.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> After eating, Peter said he  has something for me.  Then he took a  foldable lounge chair going downstairs with me to the garage. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180681.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Peter  said the floor is too cold; it will be more comfortable sleeping on the lounge  chair. </p>
  <p> I am so touched, and then I do  not need to sleep on the hard and cold ground surface.  </p>
  <p>There is light in the garage, and electric  plug in as well, and then I can finish the travel journal before I sleep  tonight. </p>
  <p> Then tomorrow I have the whole  day to ride the bike; hopefully I can ride up to 200km (124 miles).   </p>
  <p>After pulling out the sleeping bag and ready to wrap myself in there to  wrap the travel journal, </p>
  <p>Peter asked me another thing, do you want to take a  shower?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Shower?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  last time for a shower was over a week ago. </p>
  <p>And this week I have not even wiped myself with a towel because the  weather is too cold, </p>
  <p>I wouldn’t be able to take it wiping myself with a cold  towel.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> I wanted to say yes, but I felt I  would trouble them. </p>
  <p> Just when I was  saying no need to trouble, Peter said, no trouble.  </p>
  <p>Then I took a towel, toothbrush, and  toothpaste upstairs, thinking I will be happy able to wash myself with hot  water.  </p>
  <p>Peter said he hope I can take a  bath, this way is easier for him. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> By  just listening to him, I know he wanted me to take a relaxing bath, </p>
  <p>but I know  if I said no need to trouble just a shower will be fine, so I can’t decline  once he said a bath is easier for him.   </p>
  <p>Regardless how you think I know a bath is not easier than a shower, but  Peter’s excuse is adorable and sweet. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180684.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When  I took the towel and the toothbrush to the bathroom, the tub was already filled  with hot bubbly water.  </p>
  <p>After a nice meal  it is the priceless hot bubble bath. </p>
  <p> I  happily cleaned myself, and I had thought I wouldn’t have a chance to bath  until I get to Paris. </p>
  <p> I can’t believe  this happened early.  </p>
  <p>After cleaning up,  I said good night to Peter and Ulrike whom were sitting in the living room  watching TV,</p>
  <p> I was ready to go downstairs to the garage to sleep.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Then Peter rose up and said if I can sleep in  a bedroom tonight, not he garage, it would not trouble him as much.  </p>
  <p>This, me, I can’t even find an excuse to say  no.  </p>
  <p>Peter brought up the lounge chair  from the garage upstairs,</p>
  <p> and I followed behind him with my sleeping bag and  the laptop.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The first room is a painting  room, and there are even heater provided for warmth. </p>
  <p> Outside in the dark is about 5 degrees Celsius  (41F), but it is very warm in  the bedroom. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180686.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  couldn’t believe my luck, someone nice brought me home, I got a map, ate a nice  meal, </p>
  <p>had a warm bath, and now sleeping in a warm house. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Before I going to bed, Peter made a big pot  of coffee; he is putting inside a thermo so I can take it with me for  tomorrow.  </p>
  <p>Since the coffee is hot right  now, I drunk a big cup to kick away the sleepy bug. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180694.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But  I need to finish the travel blog before going to bed tonight.  </p>
  <p>Since I have been going to bed around 9pm the  last few days, I do not have any power to stay up and fight off the sleepiness.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I was drinking the coffee, I found a  white envelope on the table. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180696.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>For  Deray,</p>
  <p> to be opened in Paris.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even  though I am very curious what is inside, but I will wait until I get to Paris  before I open it.  </p>
  <p>Peter, I caused you so  much trouble, but you don’t think any of this is trouble,</p>
  <p> today is to be  remembered, and this is because I met a great German.</p>
