  <p class="style5">Rule of the cyclist</p>
  <p>I kept thinking today is Sunday, so I  thought no one would wake up early for work, so I let myself sleep until  7am.  </p>
  <p>I slept soundly in the tent for 9  hours, then I wondered how come it is very loud outside, </p>
  <p>after getting out of  the tent I realized it was Saturday today. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I estimate I will arrive at my destination on September 12, 2008,  </p>
  <p>counting the days, if lucky; it will be in Paris next Wednesday.  Then the long trip will end.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180784.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Once  I start missing home the time starts to pass slowly, if not counting today,  </p>
  <p>just count from the Germany/France border, just 3.5 more days riding to  Paris.  </p>
  <p>It is scary counting the days  backwards.  After collecting all my  things, this is my last day in Germany. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> It is hard to determine whether today’s weather is good or bad, but at  least it didn’t start raining when I got up.   </p>
  <p>But the clouds are covered with dark clouds, just the same as every  other day. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180786.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even  though I had though I need to hurry to finish the last day in Germany, </p>
  <p>but after  studying the map last night I found I am not very far from the border, but I  had thought I am in the middle of Germany.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After getting into Germany, there wasn’t a day I didn’t get lost,  </p>
  <p>turning east and west but at least I am getting going towards the southwest.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But too bad I rode too much extra road.  Before I left, </p>
  <p>I found another place to write  the travel journal, this looks like some activity center that hasn’t opened for  the day yet. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> After finishing writing the  travel journal, I used wireless Internet to get the journal online.  </p>
  <p>I absolutely love the fact Europe has high  Internet coverage.  </p>
  <p>I can say as long as  there are homes, there is Internet coverage. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180791.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Two  photos, some small paragraph, but I spent the whole morning doing this; it was  noon by the time I left.  </p>
  <p>I kept thinking  since I am not far from the border, no hurry, I can get there easily.  </p>
  <p>Yes, it isn’t far away, about 100km (62 miles) but the path isn’t that  easy. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Minus  getting lost, finding my way, getting around, and asking for direction, it isn’t  easy at all. </p>
  <p> As soon as I get into the  city, I will be in panic mode.  </p>
  <p>Even if I  follow signs, I will still get lost.  I  go around all the way, but I will end up in the same spot.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180799.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>People  in south Germany is very friendly, it has been a long time since people cheered  for me when I ride the bike. </p>
  <p> This is  because in Europe, there are so many people like me traveling through on their  bicycle.  </p>
  <p>Everyday I will see at least a  dozen people like me.  But the funny  thing is, no one will stop and chit chats.   </p>
  <p>There is just time left for passing by, nodding the head and smile,</p>
  <p> if I  meet them in either Russia or Kazakhstan, then it will be totally different.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  map Peter gives me is very useful, but it is only for the big roads.  </p>
  <p>A lot of roads are cars only which is not  shown on the map.  </p>
  <p>Then I will sigh when  I get on the bike, opening the map and trying to figure out how can I go around  this path,</p>
  <p> trying to find substitute roads for bicycles only.  </p>
  <p>Good thing the signs are very clear, city names,  distance, direction, as clear as the road signs, </p>
  <p>but it is hard to determine  which ones are bicycle allowed path.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180800.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>They  are not as clear as normal path; they are usually mixed with country roads,  small bridges, and path between homes. </p>
  <p> The worst thing is even though the signs are straight line, but when I  ride it they aren’t straight but with twists and turns. </p>
  <p> Besides, the bicycle lanes connect to each  other, and I can’t determine which direction I am supposes to go. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Tons  of cross roads, but generally there are no signs for those cross roads. </p>
  <p> So every time I get away from the big roads,  started using bicycle only path, </p>
  <p>then the light inside me will tell me be ready  to get lost, and the map won’t be any help either.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is because bicycle paths are too small,  the maps don’t show them, </p>
  <p>so the only way to get out of the bicycle path maze  is asking other bicycle rides or runners on the road. </p>
  <p> Tomorrow is Sunday; all the stores will be  closed.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On Saturday, there will be  Farmer’s market, it looks very festive, </p>
  <p>and they look like they are ready to  close now, so the goods will be cheaper.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180802.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Taking  the last working day to shop for some items in the grocery store. </p>
  <p> I need to purchase today and tomorrow’s food,  so 2 days worth of money I can spend.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180806.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  purchased 1 loaf of bread, some Prince chocolate cookie that I had purchased  before, and some layered chocolate cookies.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The items at the grocery store are huge packages, so I should be ok  eating those foods for 2 days.  </p>
  <p>When I  got lost I passed by an airplane museum, they aren’t showing some old planes,  but some very new passenger jet planes.   </p>
  <p>There are lots of people waiting in line to go inside. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180809.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  realized I passed by this place twice, because after I got lost, I came back  again. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I had thought I left the city,  but I didn’t get out of it, so I tried another path.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180811.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On the map, they use gray to signal city  center, but the roads aren’t not shown in the map. </p>
  <p> Actually this is good; otherwise the map will  be too packed. </p>
  <p> Ideally, it would be good  to find the “i” sign when entering the city, </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>otherwise then I will have to use  luck to get out of the city. </p>
  <p>I took some  big road earlier, turning around now I use bicycle path only, did you see the  green bicycle signs? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180812.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Those  roads are only for pedestrian and bicycle only, the view from the top of the  bridge. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180818.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Ducks  and more ducks, I shared a piece of toast with them. </p>
  <p> But since I am counting all my food rations,  so please consider I couldn’t share too much with you.  </p>
  <p>I will be grateful if you can sacrifice one  of you guys for me. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I will see some  yellow machine in the entrance of the city, on it says “SIE FAHREN”, </p>
  <p>at first I  didn’t know what it means, but every time I pass it there will be number  showing. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180820.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But it doesn’t look like a thermometer,  after looking at it for a while I realized it is speedometer.  </p>
  <p>This allows the driver entering the town to  be aware how fast they are driving, so the driver will slow down.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Currently my speed is 15km/hour (9.315 miles/hour), after  discovering what it is I rode back and forth few times,</p>
  <p> I am curious how it  works.  Some random picture, one needs to  be careful in Germany,</p>
  <p> from planes, snows, and now even frogs.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180822.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some  unknown plant, there is reddish purple flowers, but no fruit, about 1.5m, the farmer is currently harvesting. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180823.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  feel special riding on bicycle lane today passing through fields. </p>
  <p> Regardless what it is, they plant fields of  everything, including radish, and it is planted on the whole field. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180825.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And  all the radish plant is huge, yesterday I told Peter I have the urge to steal  them when I saw them yesterday, </p>
  <p>but I wouldn’t know how to cook them after I  get them.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180826.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Entering the city again, and facing a  cop.  The motorcycle cop stopped all the  cars on the road, even myself on the bicycle, </p>
  <p>he signed me to stop on the side  of the road.  After the motorcycle cop is  the car cop, wow, and the whole road with no car. </p>
  <p> In Taiwan, this means some politician is  passing through, but in Germany why would they need to stop everyone?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180828.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After the cop then comes a Smart car,  behind it are roller skaters.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180829.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are so many of them, about 300 or so, they all line up passing through, looks  very dramatic.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180832.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When  I took out the camera the passing by skaters will say hi, signaling the peace V  sign, they look so happy. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180836.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So many people, how many people are there  exactly?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180834.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Still  not finished, it is like a lightening activity, suddenly lots of people, all  skaters, and then suddenly all disappeared. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180838.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The last one following is an ambulance, and  then another cop car. </p>
  <p> The cops aren’t  opening the road for some politicians, but ones who are enjoying sporting  events. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Every time when I pass by trees  with fruit I will go see if there is anything I can eat.  </p>
  <p>The left black fruit should be blueberry, the  reddish one on the right I am not sure what it is.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180841.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The elementary school teacher taught me  right, if I am not sure what it is, and then I shouldn’t put it in my  mouth.  </p>
  <p>I will see tons of farm type  things in the market, but how come I can’t find those fields outside?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All the fruit I picked ended up being apples,  this is probably because I only know apples. </p>
  <p> I am not eating very healthy lately, so I should pick some apples for  food.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180846.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are lots of varieties of apples; this type is different from the type I picked  before. </p>
  <p> All the ones here are red, very  small, looks like some sweet apples. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180847.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  picked a few apples that looked good putting them in my pocket.  </p>
  <p>Before I eat them, I will have to remember to  wipe them on my pants for cleanness. </p>
  <p> I  am very proud that I still remember basic hygiene, I found I haven’t washed  this pants for a week.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The street lamps  here must not be cold; there are lots of Morning Glory plants growing on  it.  </p>
  <p>When the flowers bloom, the street  lamp will become a huge bouquet of flowers.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180844.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  cities in Germany will have signs by the entrance displaying the name.  </p>
  <p>There will also be small letters underneath,  just like a description, using 5 or 6 words describing this town’s specialty.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This town’s specialty is walls.  Looking at the road passing through the walls  then you will know why,</p>
  <p>there are 2 small doors on the left and right for  pedestrian and cyclist to pass through. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180849.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  are lots of tracks for this train station, so this must be a big stop.  </p>
  <p>Continuing riding toward the west, then I will  enter towns with TGV. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180850.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Right  now I am lost, I had just asked direction from another cyclist.  </p>
  <p>But the guy said he had just moved here  earlier, and he is doesn’t know directions either. </p>
  <p> I said that is ok, you can just pick a random  direction; this is because I have been unlucky lately.  </p>
  <p>Good thing the guy picked the correct one, I  left the town successfully.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Another  time on the bridge I asked a couple for direction, they said just turn right  ahead to get out of the town. </p>
  <p> So I  thought I understood and then waved good-bye. </p>
  <p> After I got off the bridge turned left I met the same couple again. </p>
  <p> The couple used hand signal to tell me I took  the wrong turn, I should have turn the other direction.  </p>
  <p>I am total lost between left and right, but I  can ride this far on my own. </p>
  <p> I don’t get  lost all the time, just sometimes, so this is amazing for me to get this far. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  Even  though riding bicycle only lanes makes feel I will get lost even more,</p>
  <p>but  everyone time when I see bicycle only lanes I have ride on it, </p>
  <p>this is because  the bike feels it is being respected for riding on it.  </p>
  <p>Here I can usually see the local cyclist that  are nodding, weaving and smiling at me.   </p>
  <p>So the whole day I see lots of smiling Germans.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180852.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Every  10km (6.2 miles) or so, I will  get into a new city,  and then my trouble comes.  </p>
  <p>This time the  town is hosting the music festival, so all the roads are closed. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180855.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Close  off road is fine, but at least hang a U sign to let me know how I can go around  these roads.  </p>
  <p>The festival location is at  the city center, where all the big roads meets so I must crossing by here, but  I am denied to pass through.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I  randomly trying to pass through, riding to the outskirts I see this map. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180856.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  came from the north, I need to go toward south, but now I am on the road on the  right.  </p>
  <p>If I continue to ride, I don’t  know where I will be.  So I ended up  riding for no reason,</p>
  <p> I need to get back to the town with the road blocked  off.  </p>
  <p>Since I am not allowed to pass  through the big roads, then I will have to find bicycle lanes to pass through.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180857.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Going  back to the music festival location, looking at the stage and the lots of food  stands.  </p>
  <p>Even the blocked off road have  tons of tables and chairs set up, everyone are eating and drinking beer.  </p>
  <p>It isn’t that I don’t have money; I just don’t  have Euro on me.  </p>
  <p>After saving my money  living thrifty for a week, I am getting used to it.  </p>
  <p>My eyes no longer look for hotel and  restaurant signs.  </p>
  <p>But looking at lots of  wonderful food in front of me, plate after plate, </p>
  <p>with the tourist eating all  of it, this really blows my ego for trying to save money.  </p>
  <p>So I opened the chocolate cookies to eat,  this way I won’t get so hungry.  Looking  at people eating good food is my weakness. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  order to get to the France/Germany border, I need to ride on the bicycle only  lane, </p>
  <p>this is because all the big streets forbidden bicycles.  </p>
  <p>However the road conditions are very  different.  When I cross the forest the  ground is dirt road.  </p>
  <p>But since I had  just changed to new tires, it is easy to ride on dirt road. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180866.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But which road should I take?  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180869.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The place I am going is called Ettlingen,  the sign points to the right,</p>
  <p> but there is no right at this crossroads, so I  randomly picked one directly.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then at  the next crossroad I found all 3 signs says Ettlingen, so which way should I  take?  </p>
  <p>Looking at where the sun is  setting, it is right going toward the west.   </p>
  <p>Even though the bicycle lanes are this hard to figure out, there should  be way to get on the correct road even with some twist and turns.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After passing through the forest I saw the  big road underneath, leading toward the place I am going to. </p>
  <p> There are motorcycles on the road, but it  does not allow bicycles, very not fair.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180871.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After passing through this sky bridge I  will get into another forest.  </p>
  <p>I kept  asking for directions from people who seem nice, but the answer I got are all  the same. </p>
  <p> I can get there regardless  which direction I take.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180872.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just then an older couple walking out of  the forest, they are picking walnuts while walking, all wrapped up in some  napkins.  </p>
  <p>They give all the walnuts to  me.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180874.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had thought walnuts need to be cooked  first, but apparently walnuts can be eaten raw. </p>
  <p> I used my foot to crush the hard shell, the inside nut is white, yummy,  and healthy. </p>
  <p> Free food coming my  way.  This couple also told me I could  get to Ettlingen regardless which direction I take,</p>
  <p> so I decided to ask another  way. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Which direction do I need to take  to get to France?  Just one answer for  this, going toward west. </p>
  <p>Finally passing  through the thick forest, back on the paved road, </p>
  <p>however there are no street  sign here just like bicycle lanes.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180876.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  continue to ask for direction, hoping before sun down I can find a place to  rest. </p>
  <p> I had thought I needed to sleep  inside the forest tonight; the thought had worried me earlier. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180882.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But  I saw sunset today, the sun already gone down for the day.  </p>
  <p>The clouds look like it will break, I will  see in the next few days if the weather will get better.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Because I took bicycle lanes today so I got  lost quit a bit,</p>
  <p> but because I am taking the bicycle lanes I can cross through  those no bike roads.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If there is a map  of bicycle lanes on hand, then riding in Germany will be God send.  </p>
  <p>Because I had gotten lost, so I didn’t get a  chance to enter France today, but at least I am getting toward the border.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Right now I am in between Germany and France,  a river separates the two countries.   </p>
  <p>Tomorrow I will need to figure out how to cross the river, either by  boat or whatever.  </p>
  <p>Then after getting  into France, I will need to climb some mountains that will waste a day. </p>
  <p> There is about 400km (248 miles) left from where I am straight to  Paris, but riding a bike is about 500km  (310 miles) or so. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/map.jpg" width="900" height="469" /></p>
  <p>If  takes 3.5 days to ride, then each day I need to ride at least 150km (93 miles).  </p>
  <p>Right now I am following my original plan to  reach Paris.  </p>
  <p>If once I enter France I  can’t update the travel blogs that means I don’t have 3-4 hours of free time  every day to write the travel blogs.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today’s blog I am able to finish before going to bed, this is because I  found store that is closed.  </p>
  <p>Sitting on  the bench in front of the store wrapped up in the sleeping bag and typing on  the laptop, I will sleep here tonight. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180890.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  safety in Europe is not much worry, 99% of the people are wealthier than I am,  what is the point robbing a poor man?   </p>
  <p>Tomorrow I will have the whole day to ride the bike, after I wake up it  will be the start of France.</p>
