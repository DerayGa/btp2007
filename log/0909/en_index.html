  <p class="style5">My Secret Weapon</p>
  <p>I didn’t take out the sleeping bag or the  mattress pad the night before.  </p>
  <p>I just  wrapped myself up in the sleeping bag and slept on the bench in front of the  store for the night.  </p>
  <p>The next morning the  guy delivering the paper woke me up.  I  didn’t realize I would sleep well like this too.  </p>
  <p>It started raining lightly when I was getting  ready to leave in the morning.  </p>
  <p>This wasn’t  a big problem since the rain wasn’t big, besides I have been rained on a lot lately  so this little rain doesn’t bother me.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, the bike was weird, it felt like it doesn’t want to move.  I bent down to check it and found out the  back tire was out of air.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180892.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even  though I knew the back tire has problems loosing air, but I thought it was just  low pressure.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But after I wake up now  the whole tire has no air, it looks like someone has let out the air  completely.  </p>
  <p>Is it possible something  poked it?  I was suspicious, but the  probability isn’t high so I still took off the tire and check.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180895.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  had thought after I changed to the new tire, </p>
  <p>the tire wouldn’t burst again on  the way to Paris  so I had not planned to open up my tools, but it is not avoidable.  </p>
  <p>After my inspection, I didn’t find any holes,  and the outer tire doesn’t seem to have any damage either.  </p>
  <p>So I pumped the inner tube to see if I can  find where the hole is, but I still cannot find any.  </p>
  <p>So I pumped the tire back up and put it back  on the bike. </p>
  <p> I felt like I had wasted  all this time but how come a perfectly good tire will not have any air?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While I was inspecting the tire, I took out  the multi-purpose tool.  It looks like  this after I have separated the whole thing.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180898.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  trip gives me a big lesson, rather than taking lots of tools that I might be  using,</p>
  <p> I should have taken a good tool that I would use. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I shouldn’t take a multi-purpose tool that  may not have much use to me, </p>
  <p>because when I actually use it, it is hard to use  and I would get angry.  </p>
  <p>After putting the  tire back I tried to move the bike, but the bike still wouldn’t move.  This time the chain got caught. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180900.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is a brand new chain; the chain got locked just after a tire change.  </p>
  <p>I put on my working gloves and tried to get  it back to normal.  </p>
  <p>I had thought if the  chain is back to normal everything will be ok, but this is just the start.  </p>
  <p>Because the chain is caught, so a small  section is now bent, </p>
  <p>so when I ride the bike speed will change automatically  every time the chain goes around one time regardless which speed I set the bike  to. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> It is hard to describe how it feels,  but my conclusion is “how can I ride like this?”  </p>
  <p>So I got off the bike tried to fix the chain  with some force, but the chain is too hard, and I don’t have enough  strength.  </p>
  <p>So without any tools I couldn’t  bend the chain back.  The only thing I  could do was to ride slowly toward Germany/France border.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180901.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  just had rained lightly in the morning so the sky is dark; it has the feel that  we don’t know when it will rain again.   </p>
  <p>Right now I am about 20km  (12.4 miles) from the border.  </p>
  <p>The Germany/France  border here is separated by a river.  </p>
  <p>The  other side of the river is France,  and of course where I am is Germany.  </p>
  <p>Looking at the map I noticed I needed to ride  a lot more before getting to a big city, there will be a bridge I can go to  cross the river.  </p>
  <p>The map does show lots  of accessible roads next to the river, but none of them show a way to get  across.  </p>
  <p>However, I wouldn’t know the  actual situation without going there in person, </p>
  <p>so I rode close to the river  and I saw boats that can go across.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180905.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If  I can easily cross the river on the boat then I do not have to ride extra, </p>
  <p>and  no need to go into a city or cross a bridge.   </p>
  <p>Next to the pier there is a post stating the price, </p>
  <p>but I have no idea  what it says not because it is in German but because it is written so  complicated</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180909.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Right  then there is also a grandpa taking his grandson on the boat so </p>
  <p>I asked him how  much it would be for the bike and myself the answer was $1.5 Euro  ($2.25USD).  </p>
  <p>Good thing I have enough  money on me, and today is Sunday so all the stores are closed.  </p>
  <p>Other than the fee to cross the river today,  there is no other place I can spend money.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the only pier in 5km  radius (3.1 miles) with the only boat.   </p>
  <p>Even though the posting stated pricing but there is no stated time when  the boat will leave.  </p>
  <p>So I had the  grandpa asking the crew that is cleaning the boat when will the boat  leave?  </p>
  <p>The crew doesn’t have an exact  answer either since the captain went to get some coffee.  </p>
  <p>Whenever the captain returns is when they  will leave, and they do not know when the captain will return</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180911.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So  I bought the ticket and waited on the boat, since it would save me at least an  hour by taking the boat than crossing the bridge.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180915.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  got this little receipt after paying $1.5 Euro, however no information on it is  correct, </p>
  <p>they even have the date printed as September 17, 2008, and the price  being 4.5 Euro.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is a website for  this boat too, for people who are interested they can take a look at what it says,  </p>
  <p>if there is pricing place study careful then you will know how complicated it  is. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180916.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There  are lots of people taking their bike across; there are 3 of them on the boat,  but no car.  Business like this is a bit  lonely.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180917.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Talking  of business, after paying I just realized the past few times it is free taking  the boat, </p>
  <p>but this time it cost money. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I  guess if they don’t charge money, then there is no way to make a living.  </p>
  <p>However, I didn’t waste any time, I took out  my dirty and oily working gloves and tries to bend back the chain. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180922.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  is easy to see on the photo the middle of the chain is completely bent,  regardless how hard I try it won’t bend back.   </p>
  <p>So the only way is like this morning, letting it get tangled again  except opposite direction, and then with some hard pull, </p>
  <p>the chain is partly  back to normal.  </p>
  <p>I didn’t dare to use a  lot of pressure just in case I may break the chain, then I wouldn’t be able to  ride the rest of the way.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the middle  of fixing my bike, the captain returned from his coffee.  </p>
  <p>The boat left shore very smoothly, and I didn’t  even feel anything.  By the time I felt  it, the boat had already left the shore.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180924.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Quickly  I removed my dirty gloves and took some pictures with the camera.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180927.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  took about 2 minutes to get to the other side, a little money I will just  pretend it is for captain’s coffee.  </p>
  <p>On  the other side of the river is France.  Right, it is this easy, already entered France. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180930.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>There is no customs or immigration officer  here to check luggage or passport, easily I went from Germany to France,</p>
  <p>and there is no feel of  getting into another country.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180931.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Thanks  to the grandpa looking at the price for me.   </p>
  <p>On Germany’s side I  said thank you to him in German, and then in France I said thank you again in  French.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is another little bicycle  sign, but smaller and different, there is a little “F” in the end of the  location name.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180932.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Everyone,  this is France.  Suddenly a totally different picture,  everywhere it is farm fields.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So when I  was eating the apple I picked from the road a white horse and a black goat came  up to me.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180937.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This is like a test, which animal would you  give the apple to?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The first impression  when entering France  is there are lots of bicycle riders!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180939.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Is this the France I know?  Two years ago when I biked around France, </p>
  <p>there  are lots of roads do not allow bicycles on there that drove me nuts.  </p>
  <p>Is it possible after 2 years France now follow Germany and constructed lots of  bicycle path?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180943.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Riding  there is very nice, nice scenery, cool weather, flat road, and no cars  competing with me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180944.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Following the bike path toward the city,  there are lots of people riding bicycles.   </p>
  <p>Whenever there is a table or grassy area, I would see bikers picnic on  the side. </p>
  <p>In my heart I was hoping some family  that is picnicking would ask me to join them.   </p>
  <p>Wishing is wishing; something like this didn’t happen so I ate my toast  for both breakfast and lunch.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is a  little problem after entering the city.   </p>
  <p>I had thought the map Peter gave me was a map of Europe, </p>
  <p>but then I realized  it was just a map of Germany  with some bordering roads in France.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180949.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  would be impossible riding to Paris just with  this map; since the road to Paris  is very complicated.  </p>
  <p>For just 4 days  trip I don’t want to purchase a new map, </p>
  <p>so I used city maps posted trying to  figure out which ways I should take.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180950.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>here  first, see if I can connect to a big road and go toward west.  </p>
  <p>Germany’s borders are rivers not  mountains, so there is no need to climb mountains. </p>
  <p> However, once entering France there  are lots of uneven mountains, even if they are not steep, it will still be  difficult. </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>However, the good news is  that once entering France  it will be good weather. </p>
  <p> I have been  under lots of cloudy sky for days, so let’s have bright blue sky for a while.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180952.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even  though just a small map here, but this is better than nothing.  I better study how I can get out of.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even  though those roads aren’t steep, but it is very tiring.  </p>
  <p>There are lots of people riding bikes here,  and there are even people riding in uniforms in a group</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180959.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Climbing so tiring, how high is it  exactly?  I am embarrassed to say, it is  just 400meters above sea level.  </p>
  <p>Is it  possible because I have only been eating toast lately so I am tired, not like  before when I ate good meals?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180963.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>On  the top of this hill, there are 2 cars parked.   </p>
  <p>One of the guys is standing next to the road, and when I passed by they  waved for me to stop.  </p>
  <p>They spoke with  fluent German, and they even drove past me earlier.  </p>
  <p>Seeing me riding the bike with lots of luggage,  and the one that attracted their attention are the 2 spare tires.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180964.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>What  they are holding is my meter counter, the total right now is 13688km (8500 miles), looking  at this number, </p>
  <p>the people from the car screamed “you crazy”.  It turned out to be 2 families; the one  holding the camera is a little girl.   </p>
  <p>European families are interesting; doesn’t the dad usually hold the  camera in occasions like this?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180965.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  German dad told the little girl in the car to take a picture for everyone and  then handed her the camera, </p>
  <p>the little girl just followed what her dad  said.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After taking the picture they  asked me where I am headed?  </p>
  <p>We ended up  having the same destination; they are going to Paris as well.  </p>
  <p>So I took the chance asking if the dad has a  map of France,  can I see it? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180966.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  dad has lots of maps in the car; the storage place on the door is packed.  </p>
  <p>He fumbled around a bit and asked me which  one is better.  </p>
  <p>Then he took one that  says “1cm=10km” whole map of France.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If I want to ride farther than Paris I can still  continue.  </p>
  <p>Taking this time I opened up  the map and took a picture.  </p>
  <p>First I  found where I am at first, and then figured out what road I can take to get to Paris.  </p>
  <p>Taking a picture and took some notes down</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180969.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Writing  just few words, the dad said I could have this one, no need to write so  much.  </p>
  <p>He also wished me have a safe trip  to Paris, and they will reach Paris tonight. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180993.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So  in this way I got a map of France,  it is like playing a RPG game. </p>
  <p> I got  stopped by stranger, chat a bit, and then got a map as a gift.  </p>
  <p>So the confusing roads now became clear,  riding without a map is like missing something.   I feel better now with a map.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>From  the map there seems to be 2 roads to Paris, N3 and N4. </p>
  <p> In France, the highways all start with  “A”, the rest of the roads start with “N”, “D”, “C”, and “L”. </p>
  <p> In theory, other than “A”, the rest allow  bicycles.  </p>
  <p>However in reality, a lot of  roads are for cars only, </p>
  <p>and the map do not show which roads are for cars only  unless you go there yourself.  </p>
  <p>So now I  need to figure out what roads to take, the path I had planned are being changed  now.  </p>
  <p>So trying to figure out a path to  take, it is like what happened 2 years ago when I traveled around France.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180971.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even  though the mountain isn’t so high, but the view is very open. </p>
  <p> Looking at the farm fields, there are lots of  corns in the field.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some small town in  the mountains, there is a mini gas station here.  </p>
  <p>Seeing the gas station is this small, then I  know there isn’t lots of business here. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180978.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Most of the buildings here are family  housing, definitely a church, plus some bars, bakery, and then a post office.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180983.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After paying the ferry, the cash on me is  now even less.  </p>
  <p>I wanted to exchange some  USD on me for some Euros, just in case when I need money I have nothing on  me.  </p>
  <p>But when this thought occurred to  me, I realized today is Sunday, the day all the stores are close.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I have to last one more day, then I will  see if there is any bank open tomorrow for me to exchange some money.  </p>
  <p>Mom, I have been eating, don’t worry, even if  just eating bread, but I still fill myself, and not being hungry.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180985.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  tiny faucet, if I just press on it, lots of water will flow out.  </p>
  <p>This is probably spring water.  Taking this chance to wash my headband, and  drink a stomach full of water, </p>
  <p>filling the water bottle then continue on my  way.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180989.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>My  stomach filled with toast and spring water and I feel filled, so I just tell  myself I have ate a big meal. </p>
  <p> Then I  will eat a big meal once I get to Paris  to thank myself. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Another  town in the mountain.  Even though I have  a map in my hand, but those towns are not seen on the map.  </p>
  <p>So the scale on the map isn’t so great.  So when I use this map to ride I need to be  prepared I might get lost.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180992.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When  I get hungry I have some candies I can eat, and a packet of walnuts from  yesterday.  </p>
  <p>The walnut shell is extremely  hard; it is impossible to crack it by my hands.   </p>
  <p>So I put it on the ground and step on it. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I have to be careful with the pressure I use,</p>
  <p> just in case if I smash the whole thing then I will have to eat walnut mixed  with gravel and dust.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180995.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  walnut tastes pretty good, it has a bitter taste when first eating it.  </p>
  <p>But after some chewing there is a strong  flavor.  </p>
  <p>Even though this cannot fill  stomach, but it is a change of flavor.   </p>
  <p>Keep eating candy; I felt my mouth is about to become numb.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The very very tiny town in the mountains, but  there is a ridiculous large castle here; it is so grand I can’t keep my mouth  closed.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1180999.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If  I didn’t have my map, then usually in a place like this I would try to find the  tourist center.  </p>
  <p>But since I have my map,  I won’t go bother them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  I rode the bike today, the back tire is also loosing air all the way to the  point where it looks like it is nearly out of air. </p>
  <p> In one day, I have pumped air into the tire 3  times in order to ride the rest of the way.   </p>
  <p>So I guess there must be some hole in the back tire, but the hole is so  small so I have not found it yet.  </p>
  <p>But it  is very tiring riding and pumping the tire all the time.  In addition, riding a bike without air in it  feels very heavy. </p>
  <p> I considered changing  the inner tube for the rear tire, but since I can still ride for few hours  every time I pump the rear tire, </p>
  <p>then I better not waste my time.  </p>
  <p>Time would be better spent in riding the  bike. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Guess why I would be on the grass?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190005.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is because the road next to me is “D” road, it became for cars only.  </p>
  <p>So now I need to find bike path again.  What I had done in Germany isn’t practical here.  </p>
  <p>This is because the bike path here isn’t  planned well, so sometimes I would have nowhere to ride.  </p>
  <p>But I have no choices right now so I ended up  riding on cars only road again, </p>
  <p>and trying to find another place to turn as  soon as there is an intersection coming up down the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190007.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even though I did get out of the cars only  road, </p>
  <p>but after studying the map a bit I couldn’t find what path I can take  instead of this one.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So under the  circumstance, I ended up on the cars only road again.  </p>
  <p>The little blue sign with car on it is  getting annoying; they sometimes even have a sign that says no bike  allowed.  </p>
  <p>Then there are double signs  against me riding on the cars only road.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding about 10km  on the cars only road I had thought I might get stopped by cops.  </p>
  <p>But luckily, I didn’t and I was able to ride  to the next time.  </p>
  <p>Then I need to take  N62, but this is cars only road again, then where should I ride?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190008.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is the path I had planned to take when I got the map, but now it is  useless.  </p>
  <p>So I am flipping through the  map trying to figure out which path to take to get to Paris, </p>
  <p>but rather, I am trying to figure out  how to ride out of this town.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190011.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  seeing this street sign, I feel it is somewhat familiar, “Saarbrucken”.   </p>
  <p>The name of this town, sounds like the place where Peter’s friend  lives.  </p>
  <p>Even though this particular path  allows bike, but I better not go bother someone else, besides I don’t know the  exact address.  </p>
  <p>So I will just figure out  how to survive for the next few days.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since I can’t get out of this town before sun down, but I better enter  this town.  </p>
  <p>The first time I need to do  is to find a detailed map of this town that will be the local tourist center.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190013.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  did find it, but it is already closed.   They are so cruel, there is a traveler needing your help right now.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190015.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Good  thing right outside there is a map of this town posted.  </p>
  <p>After studying a bit I took a picture of it  on the safe side.  </p>
  <p>So now I have found a  way to get out of this town, I just hope I can follow it to let me ride out of  town.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The sky is starting to get dark,  and since I am planning to get to Paris  in 3 days, </p>
  <p>I have to ride about 150km(93.15miles)  each day.  </p>
  <p>Of course the more I can ride  the better, if I didn’t ride that much each day, then it will get harder later. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190020.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  people crossing by during sunset.   Looking in through the window of a popular restaurant, I noticed it is  time for dinner. </p>
  <p> If this is a resting  travel, then I would stay in this town, find a hotel to stay in, </p>
  <p>take a hot  shower, and then pick a nice restaurant to have my dinner.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, none of this would happen, so the  best thing is continuing riding toward my destination. </p>
  <p> If I ride harder now, then I can have a good  rest later. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190023.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Thanks  to the local map from the local tourist center so now I found D910 road.  </p>
  <p>This is not a cars only road, but bikes  allowed as well.  </p>
  <p>The sky will turn dark  in 30 minutes, so I better ride as much as I can now. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190024.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I had thought about riding in the dark with  my bike lights on.  </p>
  <p>Even though the night  is cold, but there should be a way to ride right?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Church, the door is locked as well. </p>
  <p> Right now my water bottle is empty so I  circled the church once trying to find a water faucet, but no luck.  </p>
  <p>After entering France, 2 things are getting hard  to find, water faucet and electric outlets.   </p>
  <p>Those two things happen to be what I need the most.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190029.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Riding  in the night seems easy, but it will be very difficult.  </p>
  <p>This is because in the countryside there are  no lights to guide me except the cars that are passing by, so it will be  completely dark.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The tiny headlight on  the bike is not bright enough to ensure safety.   </p>
  <p>So just riding a little in the night I already remembered what </p>
  <p>happened  2 years ago when I was in France  where I fell of the bike during the night.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>During that night, with my bloody hands I sat in a dark bus stop.  </p>
  <p>Because I had fell off the bike, I had to fix  the bike tire that burst from my fall.   </p>
  <p>Then I had to endure the pain and continue to ride and slept in the  bitter cold abandoned gas station.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190031.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Right  after all that thought, the sky turned dark.   </p>
  <p>The passing cars wouldn’t slow down just because it is nighttime.  </p>
  <p>Even thought the bike has a red flashing light  on, but it isn’t bright enough, the driver won’t see it unless they get close  to me.  </p>
  <p>The result of trying to avoid  those cars will scare both the driver and myself, followed by honking at me  from the drivers.  </p>
  <p>So the thought of  riding more during the night is not a good idea, so I better find a place to  rest. </p>
  <p> Rest well tonight then I can leave  early tomorrow.  </p>
  <p>I am not planning to writing  travel journal during the day time, so I have lots of time to ride the bike,</p>
  <p> I  would be surprised if I can’t ride at least 150km each day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  giving up riding in the nighttime I start searching for a place to sleep, the  locked church door, the closed city hall, </p>
  <p>I didn’t find a place I liked after  looking at a few places.  </p>
  <p>I wouldn’t be  able to sleep in a bus stop either, this is because in France they use clear  plastic paneling for the bus stop, </p>
  <p>so there is no way to hide in there.  </p>
  <p>The bench is also short and small; it looks  like it will be very hard to sleep on it. </p>
  <p> I am very thirsty right now. </p>
  <p> I  finally found a faucet outside a house so I went to see if there is water, but  9 out of 10 the faucet is dry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  finally found this water source.  The  night is cold enough already, </p>
  <p>and water is cold enough to be frozen.  So even if I filled my water bottle I did not  dare to drink lots of it.  </p>
  <p>I am afraid if  I drink too much cold water my stomach will not be able to take it.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190032.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Looking  at this water source, other than it gives me water; it also let me have a rest  place.  </p>
  <p>I will spend the night in the  mini park behind it.  </p>
  <p>It is this tiny log  cabin, now you can see how small it is next to the bike. </p>
  <p>This log cabin is for kids; tonight I plan to  sleep inside.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190033.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  some estimation, there is no need to get out the mattress pad or the tent since  there is no place to put it.  </p>
  <p>I will just  wrap myself inside the sleeping bag, and lean against the wood board.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190037.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>It  is very difficult to sleep, during the night my behind and my back were  hurting, </p>
  <p>and my feet were numb due to low blood circulation, so I kept changing  my sleeping positions.  </p>
  <p>The night got  colder and colder to the point I couldn’t believe it is September.  </p>
  <p>I didn’t want to scare myself so I didn’t go  look on the thermometer.  </p>
  <p>I just took a  thick clothing and wrap up my head. </p>
  <p> After separating from the cold air it got easier to sleep.  </p>
  <p>It was an ok place to sleep other than the  fact I had to change positions every 20 minutes. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  reason I picked here is because the watch showed it will rain, so I tried to  pick a place that does have a roof covering.   </p>
  <p>When I was little, I find playing in log cabins like this is  interesting.  </p>
  <p>However, when I got older  it wasn’t so fun sleeping in here, it is cold, cold, and cold to the bones</p>
