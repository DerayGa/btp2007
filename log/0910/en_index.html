  <p class="style5">I Am Slow When Blowing Against Me</p>
  <p>My body became stiff from staying the whole  night in the little log cabin.  </p>
  <p>However,  during the whole night it didn’t rain, but all the stuff that was left outside  the log cabin is now covered with the morning dew.  </p>
  <p>There is probably something wrong with my  watch.  When the watch shows it is not  going to rain, it will rain.  </p>
  <p>And when  the watch shows it will rain, and then it might rain, sometimes even 3 days  later.  </p>
  <p>When I got up this morning the  weather was pretty good, I can still see the pretty sunrise. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190043.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  went to the water pump I found yesterday and used the near frozen water to wipe  my face.  </p>
  <p>My hand became numb when I got  the towel wet with the cold water.  </p>
  <p>Using  the frozen cold water to rub my face a bit, and now my whole face became numb  as well.  Just like this, I am  awake.  </p>
  <p>This is the second day in France, so lets  continue to ride. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I still didn’t ride to  150km yesterday, and I entered  from Germany,  so I actually rode less than what I had planned.  </p>
  <p>So today I need to work hard and make up for  yesterday.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is the park where I  slept yesterday, a few long benches, some toddler duck chairs and the cabin I  slept in. </p>
  <p> I had already packed up the  sleeping bag, but the heavy shirt I used to wrap up my head is still on the  table.  </p>
  <p>Good thing I used the heavy  clothing to wrap up my head, or I would get sick from sleeping outdoor in such  cold night. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190042.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So  how cold was it exactly?  </p>
  <p>Since I already  got up, then I can find out.  It is almost  8am, the sun has already got up, </p>
  <p>but the temperature is about 5 degrees Celsius  (41 degrees Fahrenheit).  And everywhere  is covered with the morning dew</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190047.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So  how cold was it last night, this will always be a mystery.  </p>
  <p>I don’t want to know either, since this will  only make me feel colder.  </p>
  <p>I had thought  after entering France,  the cold weather will not be as harsh.   </p>
  <p>But it looks like both France  and Germany  got weird weather.  People can probably  ski on the Alps by now. </p>
  <p> After tonight, then I am pretty sure the next  few days I cannot camp outside, or there is possibility to freeze to  death.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Rubbing my shaking hands against  each other, and then looking down at the tire that has lost all its air.  </p>
  <p>Just like this, no more air in it at all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190039.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  don’t want to stop to pump air into the tire today, so I should spend time this  morning changing a new inner tube, </p>
  <p>this way I can carry on a happy feeling  while riding.  </p>
  <p>Even if I am not happy  while riding, but at least I won’t get discouraged because of broken inner  tube.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This time I finally found the cause of the  flat tire.  I couldn’t tell from the  inner tube, </p>
  <p>but I found the scratch on the outer tire.  Using a tweezers I picked out a small piece  of glass.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190045.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just  this tiny thing, this used up another inner tube.  </p>
  <p>However, think on the good side, at least I  found the cause of the flat tire, so the bike should ride better today,  right? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> However, this is just my wish,  not based on any real facts.  </p>
  <p>The watch  shows it will rain today, but I actually bike against the wind all day.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190049.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  started riding at 8am, and continued until 9pm.   I didn’t stop to rest today, </p>
  <p>and the average speed was about 13km/hour (8.08mile/hour), very very  slow.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>How much I can ride in a day  depends on the average speed.  </p>
  <p>Normally I  can ride 15km/hour,  but I try to keep it at 18km/hour. </p>
  <p> In rough estimation, if I ride 10 hours, then  with 18km/hour I  can ride about 180km/day  (112miles/day), </p>
  <p>this is 50km  (31 miles) more than riding at 13km/hour. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190057.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is huge difference.  Even though I rode  10 hours, but it isn’t as easy, the only difference is the total distance I  rode is less.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  are few reasons for riding slower, uphill and against the wind.  </p>
  <p>It is ok with uphill, because there is bound  to be downhill, so overall is ok.  But  riding against the wind has no advantage at all.  </p>
  <p>Looking at the flat road, but I need to use  the same energy I use for riding up the hill, I do not feel happy about it at  all. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190060.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>“Plat  du Jour” on this sign means the special of the day.  </p>
  <p>However, after ordering I cannot guess what I  would get, just whatever the chef decides to prepare.  </p>
  <p>Sometimes this also mean self-serve, there  are a few dishes that are all you can eat style, about $10 Euro ($15USD), </p>
  <p>it  isn’t cheap at all.  But compared to  local living standards, this is the normal cost. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190052.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  continue to eat my toast; the French ones are more expensive.  </p>
  <p>The same 750gram toast cost $0.69 Euro in Germany, but sells for $1.05 Euro ($1.58USD) in France. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190054.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Other  than toast, I cannot find anything else that will fill my stomach, this is the  only thing that is cheap and will fill my stomach. </p>
  <p> I also got a package of fruit candy.  After getting these 2 things, I just have  $0.63 Euro ($0.94 USD) left, </p>
  <p>not even a whole $1 Euro.  I am so poor, poor to the point to be cry about  it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  finishing this loaf of bread, I am not sure what I am going to eat for tomorrow  and the day after.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today the whole day I  did not find a place where I can exchange currency.  </p>
  <p>The ad on the side of the road, this probably  means by recycling every 4-spray bottle, </p>
  <p>there will be 1kg less of carbon dioxide released. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190059.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And carbon dioxide is the cause of global  warming, so everyone needs to keep recycling on his or her mind.  </p>
  <p>Just like Germany, when you purchase your  soda in plastic bottle, they will charge you extra for the recycling  automatically.  </p>
  <p>The price they charge you  for the plastic bottle recycling are almost as expensive as soda,</p>
  <p> this way  everyone will recycle those things that can be used again.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After entering France, I couldn’t see the store  charging for recycling the bottle.  </p>
  <p>In France they only have posters up, but in Germany they  are enforcing recycling, very different.   </p>
  <p>The whole day is like this weather; some small rain will come down.  </p>
  <p>This road looks flat, but because I am riding  against the wind, it is very difficult to ride.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190064.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  cloud on the sky is very pretty; the changing shapes looks like some artist made  it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Because the houses will block wind from  blowing on me, so once I enter a town it will be easier to ride. </p>
  <p> From here I can see something really tall in  the distance, something like a castle.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190071.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  could see the tall building from the front, so this is probably a church.  </p>
  <p>But I don’t feel like touring it right now,  probably because I have rode against the wind, </p>
  <p>so the whole day I couldn’t ride  very fast at all.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190080.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  my mind when I am in France,  whenever passing a town, there is a beautiful river flowing through, almost  always.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190078.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  front entrance with lots of flags hanging is usually city office.  </p>
  <p>Some are big and some are small, at this  point, I don’t know how city offices can help me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190087.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Asking  for direction or borrowing maps, I go to the tourist center.  </p>
  <p>The Internet is available everywhere.  Getting water and electricity, I go to the  gas station. </p>
  <p> But I didn’t discover gas  stations today; this is ridiculous, even gas stations are becoming rare.  </p>
  <p>So I have no water today, I am very thirsty,  and feeling down. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  towns I had passed through earlier I didn’t try to get water there, so now I am  in trouble.  </p>
  <p>Eating toast while hungry,  but too thirsty so I can’t swallow the toast. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>How  come the last leg of the road in France is so hard to ride?  </p>
  <p>The weather is so cold, and I had thought I  would freeze to death last night.  </p>
  <p>The  wind is working against me, every time I want to ride more I ended up riding  even less.  </p>
  <p>Afterwards I saw a car repair  shop, so I went and asked if they can let me have some water.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190090.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> The auto mechanic said  sure, and took me to their bathroom. </p>
  <p> In France, I can  drink the water from the tap, so I can drink however much I would like. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190089.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So  I filled 2 bottles with water, approximately 1.5L, and took them on the road. </p>
  <p> I should be able to last all day today with  the 2 water bottles. </p>
  <p> It is weird, I was  sad earlier, but now after I drink some water, I feel better. </p>
  <p> Actually the situation isn’t that bad, even  though I ride slow, but at least I am moving. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190094.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And  to think on the positive side, even though it is cold, but at least it isn’t  raining.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Just  when I was thinking about this, it started raining.  </p>
  <p>The watch showed it will rain for so many  days, and now it really started raining. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190097.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  this cold weather, I am wondering whatever landed on me is rain or snow, maybe  sleet?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  air covering in fog after it had rained, it looks like some sort of light gauze  covering the mountaintop.  </p>
  <p>I was riding against  the wind earlier on the road you see below, and now I have started riding  uphill.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190099.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In just short time, the cloud-covered sky  now shows some blue in it.  </p>
  <p>So above this  heavy cloud there is a beautiful weather.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190101.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If  I am taking a plane and go upward, pass those heavy clouds, then I can probably  see lots of bright sunny weather.   </p>
  <p>Looking down is the ground covered with rain and clouds.  In weather like this when will it get sunny  again? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Today  the sunset came early too, and the whole day other than riding the bike I didn’t  do anything else.  </p>
  <p>But I didn’t get very  far, even though I had wanted to ride extra to make up yesterday’s portion, </p>
  <p>but  I didn’t even ride today’s quota either.  </p>
  <p>The sunset is very pretty, the reddish-orange sunlight colored the clouds;  it looks like the whole forest is on fire</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190107.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  am disregarding this is cars only road, I need to get up this mountaintop, so I  can view this before the sun goes down.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190109.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  marking on the cars only path says A2500m, so I had thought cars only path will only last 2500m, but it wasn’t so.  </p>
  <p>I am disregarding those cars only path right  now, I need to get up to the mountaintop, </p>
  <p>and record the image right before the  sun goes down.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190116.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Then I am wondering if my picture taking  skill is very bad, or the camera cannot record what I see in nature.  </p>
  <p>The view I saw on the mountaintop is very  different from the picture; </p>
  <p>the shock value from the real beautiful scenery is  very different.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Standing on top of the mountaintop,  I can easily see every moment of the sunset.   </p>
  <p>The clouds are flowing past fast because of the wind, and everything is  moving like it has life. </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Other than  enjoying good food in the trip, </p>
  <p>I feel I am rewarded the most from seeing  natural views like this, every sunrise and sunset, </p>
  <p>each one is different, each  requires to experience it with the heart.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190120.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  wind powered machine is seen everywhere in France, and they also flash with  light.  </p>
  <p>Even though it is neat to see  them turn and turn, but this also means the wind blows very heavy here.  </p>
  <p>Riding through with the bike is very  difficult.  The sun is almost disappearing;  the clouds are constantly ever changing.   </p>
  <p>The plane that flew by left a streak of clouds behind it, it is like  putting some marking for this view. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  riding through this cars only path, what lies ahead for me is cars only path  again.  </p>
  <p>However, I need to get past this  in order to continue my trip, otherwise I will just stuck here. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190123.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  corn field on the side of the road, even though the road condition isn’t very  good, but it is rideable. </p>
  <p> I continue to  ride in the little path on the side of the road.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190124.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  little path ends and meet up with the big road, </p>
  <p>this is the intersection of  some big road, lots of signs prohibiting me to pass by, so I ended up riding  along the exit.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190125.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  couldn’t find where I am from the map, this road is not seen from the map  either, </p>
  <p>so I need to find where I am and continues to ride toward a city. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190128.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  had not planned to ride through St. Dizier, but since I had no choice, whatever  I can ride I will ride.  </p>
  <p>I am afraid when  I have nowhere to ride, then it will be pitiful. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before  9pm the city is in dark again, of course it gets dark in the evening, but to me  it is like a curse.  </p>
  <p>Because when curse  starts, then I cannot ride anymore.   Besides, the temperature will continue to go down, faster than park  slides.  </p>
  <p>During the day the temperature  is about 15C (59F), but in the evening it is around 10C (50F), and continue to drop.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The previous night I spent it in the mini log  cabin.  </p>
  <p>Even though there is roof  covering, but if it really did rain, I wonder how good of a shield would it  be.  </p>
  <p>So I must find a decent place to  sleep tonight, if there is a hotel here that accepts credit card, </p>
  <p>then I wouldn’t  be able to resist, swiping my credit card for a nice room.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But  I had already predicted what would happen after, </p>
  <p>I would spend the whole night writing  the travel journal, and just few hours of sleep, </p>
  <p>in order to ride more I would  leave very early in the morning.  </p>
  <p>Spending  lots of money for lodging, but not really enjoying it, </p>
  <p>so I better find an  empty place to spend the night, I would probably sleep better anyway. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I didn’t find a hotel, or an  empty house, but I did find a huge storage shed outside of the town.  </p>
  <p>It is very clean inside, but dust is not  avoidable.  However, in cleanness like  this, it means someone do use it.  </p>
  <p>The doors  of the storage shed are about 2 floors high, and it isn’t closed, so I just  enter without asking. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190132.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  entering if found a small corner to spend the night.  Even if someone passes by, I am not noticeable  from the outside. </p>
  <p> If someone does come  inside, then I will explain whom I am.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190135.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Using  the flashlight to show my way, there is enough room to sleep inside.  </p>
  <p>I took out all my camping gear, there is roof  covering tonight so I can sleep well. </p>
  <p> If  it does rain, then I wouldn’t need to worry about getting wet, and getting  stiff and numb from the cold. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  I got in the sleeping bag it felt like a cold bath.  </p>
  <p>Because it had just rained, the sleeping bag  and the clothing on me has some light moisture on it, so it is quite cold.  </p>
  <p>Use my body slowly warm things up, and the  sleeping bag keeps the warmth in.  </p>
  <p>After  I got warm, I slowly became sleepy.   Without any resistance, I entered my dream. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Regardless how cold it was during the night,  as long as I can open my eyes in the morning, then it will be a brand new  day.   </p>
