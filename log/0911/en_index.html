<div align="center">
  <p class="style5">Tomorrow, Paris</p>
  <p>Indoor temperature is definitely better,  when I woke up this morning; the temperature is around 10C (50F).  </p>
  <p>Looking at the temperature I feel better  inside, this is better than temperature at single digit.  </p>
  <p>I had felt if I sleep here, people might come  in early to work, so I set the alarm up at 6am to wake myself up. </p>
  <p> I am hoping to leave here early without any  noticing me, but the alarm froze so it didn’t ring so I slept until 7am in the  morning.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When I woke up I quickly packed  up the camping gear, I was afraid I would be discovered.  </p>
  <p>Good thing when I left everything was ok, and  the temperature outside was fine too.   </p>
  <p>The clouds is still dark and dreary, the frozen fingers need some  exercise before they would move.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After I  left I remembered why I rode here, it was because of those cars only path.  </p>
  <p>Those cars only path would still be there,  they wouldn’t disappear just after my sleep, so I need to figure out a way to  ride on the cars only path.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190137.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  path I need to take clearly has cars only signs posted.  Of course I can choose to ride on it  regardless, </p>
  <p>but the end results are either stopped by a cop, cars honking at  me, or worst scenario is a car accident.   </p>
  <p>The substitute path is the country lane on the right side, but the country  lane condition isn’t very good. </p>
  <p> However,  I have no choice, there are no other road I can take, and no bicycle lanes only  either.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190139.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Initially,  the country lane follows right along the cars only path, </p>
  <p>just the road  condition is not as good, but at least the direction is the same.  </p>
  <p>But I don’t understand when the cars only  path is flat and straight, but the country path has various hills?  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Drivers in France  is not like drivers in Kazakhstan,  whom leaves the car light on all day.   </p>
  <p>The drivers in France only turns light on at night and early morning, so  when I see cars after cars with lights on, I felt it is a little too  early. </p>
  <p> Today I didn’t get to view the  sunrise since the clouds is still very thick.   </p>
  <p>However, the wind isn’t blowing against me as hard today, the wind level  has decreased.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> After riding on the country path for a while I  need to cross to the other side on the over-pass bridge.  </p>
  <p>Looking from the top, it is easy to see why  this road is cars only, it is not because of fast car speed or heavy traffic,  </p>
  <p>but the reason is because there is no place for bikes, not even a small  shoulder area,</p>
  <p>both lanes of traffic covers up the road completely.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190140.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>If  bicycle is riding on the cars only road, then all the cars will have to change  lanes to avoid the biker, </p>
  <p>and this can easily result in car accidents.  </p>
  <p>Thus the road in France isn’t planned well, this is  a nightmare for bikers.  </p>
  <p>I had this  experience in the past when I traveled through France, and now it is all over  again. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding  on the country lane I see some area that had once paved with asphalt. </p>
  <p>However, riding here I can not see any street  sign, no name at all, and no idea where those country path will lead me</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190141.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  wouldn’t be too surprised if when I reach the end it is a pasture of cornfields,  </p>
  <p>this is because this is not a real road, I need to be prepared to go back  anytime. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  plan the worse, but the ending is still hopeful.  After passing by fields and the forest, I see  signs of houses in the front.  </p>
  <p>This means  I can get on normal road to ride again. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190142.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is a moment to be remembered, this is the first sign I see in France showing Paris, but it doesn’t have any distance  showing.  </p>
  <p>In my estimation, I still have 300km (187 miles) to go.  </p>
  <p>I should arrive at Paris tomorrow, however it might be difficult  arriving there before noon.  </p>
  <p>From what I  have been riding the last few days, I will probably arrive there around sun  down.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190145.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>While trying to get to Paris,  some pictures for you of France’s  countryside.  </p>
  <p>Looking at those duck, I  feel sorry for them, the lake water must be very cold.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190148.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Good  thing I came across this town while riding so I am not totally lost. </p>
  <p> So maybe by taking small country path like  this, I might be on the way to Paris. </p>
  <p> After I left this town, the path here is  again for cars only, so I took the little country road alongside the cars only  path again.  </p>
  <p>Riding on the little path  without any car accompanying me is a bit lonely.  </p>
  <p>Listening to the sound of cars passing by I  can make sure I am riding along the correct way, </p>
  <p>otherwise I am afraid I will  get lost again.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190150.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  going around the forest I can see the cars only path underneath, I want to ride  legally on the cars only path, </p>
  <p>the easiest, shortest road, but it is a road  that doesn’t allow me to be on it.  </p>
  <p>Following  the big road, sometimes turning left, sometimes turning right, </p>
  <p>then I got onto  a road I do not know, and surrounded by mountains.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As long as I am in crossroads, there will be  signs of current location and where it is going.  </p>
  <p>This is one good thing about France,  however, those street and location can not be found on maps. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190152.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Every  time meeting a crossroadI will stop and get out the map, </p>
  <p>and look for the  location and street that cannot be found on the map.  </p>
  <p>Then I will pick a direction to ride although  I am not sure where I am going.  </p>
  <p>While  riding, I would think, would I pick the wrong one?  Maybe the other one is the correct path, do I  need to go back. </p>
  <p> I will ride like this  the rest of the way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  I get lost too much I would want to ask other people for direction.  </p>
  <p>Sometimes there are cars passing by, but no  one wants to stop.  </p>
  <p>Today is already  Monday, but when I passed by towns today, most of the places are still closed.  </p>
  <p>Finally passing by a farmhouse I see people  chatting outside, so I run over with my map to ask for directions.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190159.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  don’t care if there is language barrier, I point to the map saying I want to  get to Paris,  which road should I take?  </p>
  <p>The other  person cannot find where I am currently on the map, just some close by  locations. </p>
  <p> The good man took over my  notebook started writing down all the towns I will pass by from now on, </p>
  <p>so I  just need to follow the notes</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190162.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p> He wrote down 50km (32miles) worth of road, although once I  get into the city I will need to find the rest of the way on my own.  </p>
  <p>Taking back my notebook, looking at alphabets  that sort of look like English, </p>
  <p>so there shouldn’t be any problem taking the  notebook and go match it to the location signs, right?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now  I feel much confident, before I left I asked if I could get some water. </p>
  <p> Of course it is no problem again, and he give  me a 2L worth of  bottled water as well.  </p>
  <p>I will be able to  ride until I reach the next place that allows me to get more water.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190161.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Thank you for your good heart, so I can  decide quickly, </p>
  <p>and when I meet crossroads I meet later I will be able to pick  which way to go.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190166.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I want  to ride N4 road, if I can ride on it, then I can ride all the way to Paris, but the problem is  I cannot ride on it.  </p>
  <p>If I take small  country road, then I need to go north first, then west, </p>
  <p>make some turns, but I  will ride extra 30km  (18.7miles) more.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Another recycling ad on the wall, the same  style as the last one I saw.  </p>
  <p>This time  it says by recycling 5000 bottles, it can save a barrel of oil.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190168.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  already finished the toast I bought yesterday.   The Euro in my pocket is less than $1, after getting into this city; </p>
  <p>I  found a grocery store to get some goods. </p>
  <p> I got some mixed juice, salty shrimp chips, some smiley cookies, and a  loaf of bread.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190105.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So  how did I pay for those since I don’t have any Euro on me?  </p>
  <p>The answer is credit card.  But since I wasn’t sure if I can swipe my  card, so I didn’t dare to get too many things, </p>
  <p>and I got the bread I am already  tired with.  </p>
  <p>So if I couldn’t use my  credit card, I can return rest of the items.   The cash on me is enough to purchase the loaf of bread.  </p>
  <p>The total for all these items is $4.8 Euros,  and when I got out my credit card, </p>
  <p>the cashier didn’t’ give me any trouble just  because the amount is too low. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Finally  I purchased new food; I opened up the juice and drink half of it.  I opened up the smiley cookie and ate lots of  it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I will save the toast when I get really  hungry.  One thing good about France is that  as long as the road is seen on a map, </p>
  <p>then it means the road is paved well,  regardless how small it may be.  </p>
  <p>Just  like this road, the quality beats any road in Kazakhstan,  but this is just a small road in France started with D.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190169.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even  though I know I am riding extra due to the fact I can’t be on cars only path,  but since the road condition is this excellent, </p>
  <p>it does cut down the tiredness  a bit.  Rather than complaining, I might  as well get moving and bike faster. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> It feels like once I entered  Europe, or should I say entering France, I felt the trip has  ended.  </p>
  <p>Just few hundreds of km left, but  I still need to finish it, it will not finish on its own.  </p>
  <p>It doesn’t matter how much I talk, the one  that is riding is I.  Tossing away all  emotions, just 1 thing left, going forward.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  riding the 50km the guy  told me earlier, I am now on N4 road again,</p>
  <p> I am very thankful to the guy who  wrote directions in my notebook.  </p>
  <p>If it  wasn’t for him, then I will just randomly going on my own, and I don’t know if  I would be able to get back here.  </p>
  <p>And  even if I do get back here on my own, then it might be hours later. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190180.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Another  thing that is to be happy about is the N4 road now allows bike to be on there,  so now I can ride faster.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Cars only path  and bike are almost the same; the only difference is there is no blue sign on  the road. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190181.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  N4 road now has trucks passing by, but there is a shoulder area on the normally  very crowded road.  </p>
  <p>I try to ride closest  to the edge, away from the big trucks.   </p>
  <p>On roads with speed limit 110km/hour  (69miles/hour) it is very scary to be next to the trucks, </p>
  <p>this is because just  with the wind blowing on me I am already swerving.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Riding  on N4, I am now reunited with road signs.   </p>
  <p>When I saw the same sign this morning, it didn’t show how far I am from Paris.  </p>
  <p>Right now about 3pm in the afternoon, I have 167km (104 miles) left. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190183.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>So I am sure I will arrive at Paris tomorrow, that is, if I don’t get lost too much in Paris.  </p>
  <p>I should be able to see the Eiffel tower  before dark.  </p>
  <p>But if I want to reach  there by noon, then it isn’t just normal riding. </p>
  <p> I would have to ride tonight in total  darkness toward Paris. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Looking at the sign, I feel Paris isn’t far away anymore.  </p>
  <p>The map says on N4 only this section allows  bike, so the rest I will need to find another way.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190187.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>That is ok, I will take whatever I can  get.  If I can ride good for 1km is better than going in circles in the  same place.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Rushing on N4 on this  section toward Paris,  but I actually got a flat tire, how can this be?</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190192.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  got a flat tire on roads where huge trucks pass by, and this is the same tire I  had just changed to a new inner tube yesterday. </p>
  <p> When I left Poland  at Goose’s, I had brought 3 brand new inner tubes.  </p>
  <p>I had felt it will be fine, but just little  distance here I have already broke 2 inner tubes already.  </p>
  <p>Trying to park the bike away from the road, I  am sitting in the grass, </p>
  <p>the wind is blowing from passing by trucks, and I  quickly put on new inner tubes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This time I didn’t need to find what caused  the flat tire, </p>
  <p>anyone other than being blind would be able to see this huge  wire poked through the tire.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190194.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  am a bit sad seeing this huge wire poking through a brand new tire; it is a  good thing the frame didn’t get damaged from it.  </p>
  <p>Spending 10 minutes fixing the tire, I am not  sure how much more I can ride before sun down. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The sun is setting directly west to me,  where my destination is.  </p>
  <p>I will arrive  tomorrow.  This trip started from Beijing will just need  one more day to finish.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190198.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Tomorrow, Paris.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  have not planned to sleep tonight.  I had  planned to find a corner to rest a bit, and then ride during the early morning.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However much I can ride before sunrise, there  is possibility I can arrive at Paris  before noon.  </p>
  <p>Following N4 road I found  lots of rest stops, </p>
  <p>I think this is because the trucks aren’t allowed on  freeway, so all the freeway are on N4 now.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And at those rest stops, they have the basic 24-hour business; the area  is huge, which allows lots of trucks parked here.  </p>
  <p>When I discovered this place I had planned to  go inside to eat, get some rest, </p>
  <p>get my camera charged up, and then I will be  able to ride. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190200.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>But  then the door didn’t post a sign saying credit cards allowed, so I can’t spend  money inside. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Usually before the sun goes down, there  will still be 1 hour of light out door.   </p>
  <p>But as soon as the sun is at ground level, it will become completely  dark in 15 minutes.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190203.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  turned on my back bicycle flashing light and the front bicycle light; following  the shoulder I slowly continues to ride. </p>
  <p> It is the same road condition, but it is very different between daylight  and nighttime, at nighttime it feels much more dangerous. </p>
  <p> The cars behind will use their high beam to  shine on me first to see what is that flashing red light ahead.  </p>
  <p>When the cars discover it is a bicycle, they  will go around me. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  am not afraid to be hit, but rather falling while riding in the dark.  </p>
  <p>It is not clear the road condition ahead  since it is pitch dark; </p>
  <p>I only have 1-second time to figure out what I need to  do before reaching it.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Around 10pm I got  to this 24-hour gas station with no one there, I feel I am like an insect,  attracted by lights. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190207.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Because  there is no one at the gas station, so there is no worker here, this will be my  rest stop today.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Good thing I found  electricity plug here, so I plugged in to use it.  </p>
  <p>Placing my behind against the sleeping bag,  my back against the gas station machine, </p>
  <p>I plan to use few hours to write the  travel journals for the last 3 days.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190209.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Sitting  at the gas station with the wind blowing against me,</p>
  <p>I didn’t change anything,  just took off my gloves and changed to the slipper.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The surrounding is pitch black; anywhere  outside the gas station is completely dark.   </p>
  <p>However, this is the gas station, even if there is no employee, there  will be customers.  </p>
  <p>Where I sit at is  where people park there to get gas, so there are trucks passing by to get gas.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190211.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  guy is a truck driver; he just got here from Moscow  and going to Paris.  </p>
  <p>I point to the bike saying I am from Moscow too, and going to Paris. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once  I said this he is a bit in shock.  But  riding from Moscow  to here is just part of the trip, just 1/3 of it.  </p>
  <p>The guy chats with me while getting gas.  </p>
  <p>He speaks French, I pretend I understand him,  but my eyes and hands never left the computer. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  guy didn’t leave after getting gas.   There are lots of truckers driving in here, park, </p>
  <p>and sleep inside the  gas station, I see he looked tired as well. </p>
  <p> I am not sure how many days he is required to drive from Moscow to Paris. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>He  sit in the tuck looking at me typing away on the computer, he felt  interested. </p>
  <p> Yes, it is my sleeping bag;  the night is getting colder so I took out the sleeping bag to wrap myself up.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then  I hear sound from the truck, and smelled coffee.  </p>
  <p>The smell of coffee flew out, it is very  unimaginable, and there is coffee maker inside the truck!  </p>
  <p>So when he wants to drink coffee to get  energy he can do so any time.  </p>
  <p>He made 2  cups of coffee, one for himself and one for me. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190214.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  the cold blowing wind I can hold on to a cup of hot coffee I feel great,</p>
  <p> looking at the guy getting gas I had wanted to ask him if he can spare some for  me, </p>
  <p>this way I would have fuel for the hot plate.  But thinking I will get to Paris tomorrow, </p>
  <p>what is the point getting  fuel now? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> If the guy really do give me  fuel, </p>
  <p>then I will start the fire right here at the gas station, and tomorrow I  would probably get on the news paper. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Drinking  the hot coffee from the guy, and I can get refills too.  </p>
  <p>Saying good-bye to the guy and continue to  type on the laptop. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190217.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is what I look like now, including typing these words.  </p>
  <p>Including before when I was writing the  travel journal for today, it is rare I write what is going on currently. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  the cold night the temperature is 7C  (44.6F), but the sleeping bag keeping  me warm. </p>
  <p> In the gas station I wrote 3  days worth of travel journals, it is a bit tiring.  </p>
  <p>I wrote from 10pm all the way to 4am, total 6  hours, during which time I did not sleep at all.  </p>
  <p>Using the coffee earlier to warm myself up  and some boost of energy. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After writing the journal, I pack up the  sleeping bag and ready to leave.  </p>
  <p>From  4am to 12pm, I have 8 hours to ride. </p>
  <p> I  don’t know if I can reach Paris  before noon.  </p>
  <p>Maybe by the time you are  reading this travel journal, I already passed out under the Eiffel Tower,  or crying my heart out.  </p>
  <p>The more likely  possibility is getting lost on the road.   </p>
  <p>Regardless, whichever day, or how late it is, one day I will reach my  destination.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Let’s go, it is time to end  this trip.  </p>
