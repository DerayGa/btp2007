  <p class="style5">No hero here</p>
  <p>Around  4am in the morning with the wind blowing on me, since I didn’t change so I used  the sleeping bag to cover up myself.  </p>
  <p>But  once I leave the sleeping bag I don’t have any extra clothing to put on.  </p>
  <p>In the dark night with the freezing wind  blowing directly to my spine, </p>
  <p>the bike handle is covered with the frozen  morning dew; it felt so cold holding it.  </p>
  <p>The water in the water bottle is very precious, but I still pour some  out on a towel, and use the towel to wipe my face.  </p>
  <p>This counts as another shower.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  the star covered sky, I stand on the hard ground and felt like the ground is  moving.  </p>
  <p>My body keep leaning to the  back, just like I am drunk, can’t stand straight.  </p>
  <p>Wasn’t just one night no sleep to write the  travel journal?  Is the side effect this  serious?  </p>
  <p>In a moment I will have to ride  on the road, this will be ok, right? </p>
  <p> I  am not able to stand straight, but this doesn’t mean I can’t ride the bike. </p>
  <p>I only have to step on the pedals to ride the  bike.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190219.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>In  the pitch-black night, I can’t see anything; I don’t know where the moon has  gone.  </p>
  <p>If I need the star to guide me,  then I will need to find a pair of night goggles. </p>
  <p> I can see things once awhile when cars  passing by me.  </p>
  <p>Sometimes the cars  driving against me passes by from the front, the harsh headlights makes my eyes  feel like it is going blind.  </p>
  <p>Other than  the cars passing by guiding me, I am depending on the bike.  </p>
  <p>Since there is barely any light, I took out  the flashlight to guide my way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>fter  sleeping in bus stops so many times, and listening to cars driving past by, </p>
  <p>now  I know the least number of cars on the road is between 3-6AM.  </p>
  <p>Leaving at 4am I need to be careful, not to  ride into a gravel pit or a hole, otherwise it should be safe.  </p>
  <p>I believe a car will not hit me; </p>
  <p>this is  because even though the only thing showing my existence is a little flashing  red light, but it works very well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A  I can hear from far away a car is coming, </p>
  <p>and  usually I can guess if it is a truck or a small car, then the cars will shine  on me with their high beam light, </p>
  <p>slow down, pass by me from far away, and then  speed up and drive away.  </p>
  <p>But if there  happens to be another car blocking and the car can’t pass by me, </p>
  <p>the driver  will patiently drive slowly behind, and will pass me at the appropriate time. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Every  time a car passes by me, I will say to myself, they can’t hit me,</p>
  <p>it will be  fine, they can’t hit me, relax, they can’t hit me, don’t be afraid.  </p>
  <p>However the thing I am afraid the most is  falling down.  </p>
  <p>Even if the cars behind me  will try to avoid me, but I still try too ride toward edge.  </p>
  <p>Of course when I do, there is the possibility  of riding on gravel and sandy road surface. </p>
  <p> In the pitch dark night my sight level is not very clear, when something  appears in my lighted area,</p>
  <p> I only have one second to figure out what it is,  and if I need to avoid it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> I feel thirsty, but drinking water has no use,  this is because riding in the dark makes me feel nervous, the thirstiness is  caused by the stress. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  the night I see the animals such as squirrel, skunk, etc flattened by the car,  </p>
  <p>and the road surface reflect the reddish blood and skin, it looks 10 time more  scary than during the day. </p>
  <p> I kept  pushing the light on my watch to find out what time it is.  </p>
  <p>But the more I check the time the slower the  time passes by.  </p>
  <p>I had thought there would  be light by 6am, but it wasn’t so. </p>
  <p> Finally at around 6:30am, the far away horizon finally has some  sunlight, I made it to daylight. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190225.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Every  time when I see sunrise, I will tell myself where the sun is coming up is my  home, it is not far away at all,</p>
  <p> just on the other side of the horizon.  </p>
  <p>And every time I see the sunset, regardless  where I am at,</p>
  <p> I will tell myself where the sun is going down is my  destination, just a hand touch away, almost there.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  the dark night combined with a little light, right now I am in the middle of  darkness and sunlight. </p>
  <p> It is very  amazing feeling being in a huge field feeling the night and day changes.  </p>
  <p>Before the sun came up, the sky has lots of  beautiful colored clouds;</p>
  <p> it looks like ribbons sitting in the sky.  The clouds are covered by the sunlight  colors.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190235.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Even  though I am trying to ride as much as I can, I still stopped and stood by the  bike to enjoy this beautiful scenery.</p>
  <p>I  didn’t sleep all night but I got this beautiful sunrise.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Of  course riding in the night I can’t be wearing sunglasses, this is like riding  blind.  </p>
  <p>So I changed to my normal  glasses, putting the sunglasses on top of the bag. </p>
  <p> I had put the sunglasses on top of the bag  before and never saw it drop.  </p>
  <p>When the  sun came up it is after 7am already.  It  is today, before the sun gets to the top, I have to get to Paris.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190240.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Just  when I am about changing to the sunglasses to ride, since wearing glasses I  look dorky, </p>
  <p>I realized I don’t know where the sunglasses went?! </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My  goodness, the same style sunglasses I have lost 2 of them. </p>
  <p> I don’t know where the sunglasses fell off  during the shaky ride, and to go back is impossible.  </p>
  <p>I can’t get the sunglasses back even with how  sorry I am, so I ended up wearing the normal glasses to ride.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  the sun came up, I finished riding the N4 section that allows bike.  </p>
  <p>After this N4 will become cars only path  again, but this also means Paris  is near.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190243.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Turning into D231 road going toward the  sign that points to Paris.  </p>
  <p>The fastest way to Paris is A4, but it is a freeway and bike isn’t  allowed.  </p>
  <p>So I will have to go around and  try to get into Paris.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Paris  is a big city, with lots of parks surrounds the city.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/map2.jpg" width="900" height="458" /></p>
  <p>Two  years ago when I rode from the southeast, </p>
  <p>just riding to the city center got me  frustrated, the whole path is very complicated.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the time regardless how I try I couldn’t into the city, </p>
  <p>I ended up  having to ride on the A4 freeway to get to the destination, but I don’t want to  do that again.  </p>
  <p>This time I am riding  from the east toward Paris, following the sign  says Paris,</p>
  <p> seeing it changing to freeway I know  I am near Paris. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190246.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Start  riding at 4am, I got to the outskirts of Paris  around 9am, the speed is surprising.   </p>
  <p>Seeing a river that I thought is the Seine  River, seeing houses I thought it is  the Louvre Museum, </p>
  <p>but I have no idea where I am,  and it felt like I am toward my final destination.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190244.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  getting into the city, the map is not useful anymore, </p>
  <p>turning left and right  trying to avoid the streets that don’t allow bikes, but those are also the  fastest way going to Paris. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190252.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Two  years ago when I was under the same situation I felt pitiful, the motorcycles  can go, but why not bicycles?  </p>
  <p>So back  then I got onto A4 freeway, it would be hard to believe I can’t get to Paris without riding on  bicycle allowed path. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Looking at the  direction the freeway is going, and then I try to find substitute path going  toward similar direction, </p>
  <p>passing one area after another, and going toward the  city center.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190253.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>And seeing the river again, this isn’t the Seine River,  so just following the riverside I can’t get to my destination either.  </p>
  <p>I am glad this time I brought the compass; I  don’t know how I can get into the city without it. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190256.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Feeling  I am going toward the right direction, but there is no way to prove it.  </p>
  <p>So when I see someone I will take the map  over and go ask direction.  </p>
  <p>There are  lots of tourists in Paris,  anywhere you can see tourist looking for direction with a map in hand. </p>
  <p> Just like this guy, he is holding a map of Paris. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190261.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>This  is very useful, one can buy this at the newspaper stand for $10 Euro ($15USD),  </p>
  <p>but I don’t have this kind of money to spend right now.  </p>
  <p>The pink area the guy is pointing to is the  city center, this is not far away,</p>
  <p>if I just ride a little bit to the west, and  follow the Seine River. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Also,  when I asked this guy where the Eiffel   Tower is, he told me it  is very far from here, some more KM of road. </p>
  <p> I assured him, it isn’t far, not far at all.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>  Thanks to the guy, I arrived at Paris.  On this trip every time I get into a big city  I will stop by the city sign and take a picture. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190268.jpg" width="900" height="998" /></p>
  <p>This  photo has the most meaning, the destination Paris, I rode over 100kms with my blue and  white slipper to get here.  </p>
  <p>Since I lost  my sunglasses, now I have to show my real face for the photo.  </p>
  <p>Because I didn’t sleep all night, my face isn’t  very shining; </p>
  <p>it is covered with some excitement and tiredness, just like  someone who is working hard.  </p>
  <p>One is  pushing me down and the other one is making me stepping on the pedal every  time.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>First  riding 170 some km, and then sit in a gas station to rest for 6 hours. </p>
  <p> I didn’t waste that time and I sit in the  cold to write travel journal, finally rode more than 100km.  </p>
  <p>I still  feel shaky, but when I ride the bike I can still sort of keep my balance. </p>
  <p> I feel shaky too if I sit on the bike but  feet on the ground, I can’t feel balance anymore. </p>
  <p> It feels like there is gravity from all side,</p>
  <p> so when I am not careful I will fall to the ground with the bike, riding with  no speed and fall to the ground.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Since my body can’t take it anymore, then I  might as well take what I got and get to my final destination. </p>
  <p> This river is the real Seine River.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190273.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Getting  into Paris, I  found a packed bridge to cross the river, and then follow the river going  west. </p>
  <p>Dreaming the last left of the  travel for a while, I am almost there. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are lots of vendors next to the river  that sells everything.  </p>
  <p>I am not familiar  with Paris,  except the trip 2 years ago.  </p>
  <p>Because I was  riding the bike then, I didn’t go inside a lot of places.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190277.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  bike lane inside the city has better condition, compared to the countryside;  this is like the heaven of the bike lanes</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190282.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Comparing  to Taiwan, those big cities  don’t use traffic as an excuse; </p>
  <p>cities like Paris,  Moscow, Beijing,  and Warsaw all  have excellent bike lanes.  </p>
  <p>Those cities  can do it why not Taipei?  How about Taiwan?  </p>
  <p>Please respect bike riders, not just fine  people for what they are not suppose to do, </p>
  <p>things such as enforcing helmet  wear and licensing bicycles just limit bicycle riders, </p>
  <p>those rules do not help  them.  Those are just horrible rules that  were made.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Any  city mayor, especially Taiwan,  if they are willing to ride the bicycle to look around, </p>
  <p>they would realize it  is very difficult to ride the bicycle in the city.  </p>
  <p>No bicycle lanes, no decent planning, this  just shows bicycles are not allowed in the city.  </p>
  <p>So if people want to ride their bicycle they  would have to go to the countryside.  </p>
  <p>If  one of those days when I can ride bicycle in Taipei like the way I ride in  Paris, </p>
  <p>that kind of easiness, respected, safety, then I would say Taipei is a  first rate city as well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Paris is currently pushing for public bicycle move, the other cities in France has been  doing it for a while now. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190357.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Brand new bicycles line the street; this is  the healthy and environmental public transportation mode.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190377.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>I  admire some of the rules in Europe, such as  having high gas price.  </p>
  <p>It would be  better if it is more expensive, then everyone will have less chance to be on  the road. </p>
  <p> The expensive gas actually  includes lots or fees, such as environmental cleaning fee, </p>
  <p>in theory they  should use those fees to pay some of the public transportation cost.  </p>
  <p>This way, one can take the bus, electric car,  or MRT when traveling.  </p>
  <p>Of course able to  ride the bicycle is even more comfortable and easy going.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Imagine, if the MRT in Taipei  is like Moscow,  the same price regardless how far, all for just $15NT (US0.50USD), </p>
  <p>then how  many people would be willing to take the MRT and not drive.  </p>
  <p>Don’t say it is not possible, or the MRT is  complicated, the MRT in Moscow is bigger than  the one in Taipei County can do this, </p>
  <p>why cannot Taipei? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Paris, in more crowded  road, </p>
  <p>the bicycle and bus lane are together, in majority of the road the  bicycle has their own path to ride on.  </p>
  <p>This is not only just on the weekends, but in Paris if you ride your bicycle anywhere  anytime. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> In Taipei,  with so many traffic rules, </p>
  <p>if Taipei can manage  their bicycle rules just like Hong Kong or Paris, I can only say, go for it. </p>
  <p> I wish those high political office people can  step out and enjoy riding the bicycle in the area they govern in,</p>
  <p> experience  the same needs as the people who live in those city.  </p>
  <p>Do you want the people riding the bicycle be  getting tickets or smiling? </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190280.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Following  the riverbank, very soon I saw the very tall Eiffel Tower  in the distance, going towards the tower!</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190284.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The more I go forward the more the tower is  closer to me, </p>
  <p>everyone can imagine music in the background, to see what kind of  music is playing.  </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190286.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>The  final destination, the Eiffel   Tower. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190294.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  GPS map, the blue is the path I took. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/map.jpg" width="900" height="574" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There  is a ball game in Paris  right now; lots of guys dressed in skirts celebration their own country’s  games.  </p>
  <p>Even if there are no events, I think  regardless what time I come here; it will always be this festive.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190301.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>When  I got to the Eiffel   Tower, there is no one to  welcome me, no reporter asking questions, </p>
  <p>no white line designated the finish  line, but this is the finish I want. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lots  of tourist, lots of conversation, </p>
  <p>no one saw a dirty young man riding a bike  hanging with luggage and spare tires quietly arrived at the Tower.  </p>
  <p>With my tired body, I rode here.  I left on April 23, 2007 at 6:50am in the morning;  </p>
  <p>Mario from the cheap motel took a picture of me then.  </p>
  <p>The brand new bike, clean cloth, and me not  knowing how the trip would turn out, started here, 144 days of traveling. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1000343.jpg" width="900" height="599" /></p>
  <p>Every  day, I am thankful of everyone’s help and cheer.  </p>
  <p>Every moment, I am glad I still have energy  continue to ride.  </p>
  <p>Every minute I always remember  there are lots of people expecting me arriving to Paris.   </p>
  <p>Every second I tried to breathe to prove I did live my life to the  fullest.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  14000+km road (8700 miles), almost 5 months, the bike is now dirty, </p>
  <p>everything  that can broke has broke once, lost lots of luggage, I got darker from the sun,  </p>
  <p>my body has lots of scars, although I am not sure if I got fatter or skinnier,  but one thing I do know,</p>
  <p> I am dirty, each day dirtier than the other.  Dusting off myself, it is ok to get dirty, I  don’t care. </p>
  <p>As long as I have a breath  left in me, just with this breath, anything I want to do is possible.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Taking  out the flag from the bag, time for flying.   </p>
  <p>Putting the camera on the ground, taking the flag next to the bike, </p>
  <p>the  people passing by all stopped and looked at me with a curious look on their  face. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190341.jpg" width="900" height="1600" /></p>
  <p>The  bike leaning against the fence, all around the tourist are chatting, I can  clearly hear my heart beat.  </p>
  <p>God, if I  will die from exhaustion, then let me take this picture first.  </p>
  <p>Click, the sound of the camera, this moment  is now captured.  </p>
  <p>Time, September 12,  2007, 1:55pm.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The previous travel journals  of Taiwan  and France, people have noticed the last entry I write hastily.  </p>
  <p>Because this is just part of a trip, this doesn’t  mean the world stops, life is long, there will be lots more exciting trips  waiting for me.  </p>
  <p>So after two years  circling Taiwan I went on a  trip circling France, after  2 years I rode from Beijing to Paris.   </p>
  <p>So now where should I go?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Right  now there is only one place I want to be.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>Right  now I want to go home. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After  taking the picture, it is done.  It feels  good this is it, I have been dizzy for a while, and finally I can sit and rest.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190297.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  I sit down it felt I can go to sleep anytime, </p>
  <p>but right now there is something  I must do, I can finally open the envelope from Peter.  </p>
  <p>There is a small note inside with $50 Euro  ($75USD), this is not small amount, about $2000NT. </p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190299.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Looking  at the money inside, if I knew it was money, and then I wouldn’t have took it;</p>
  <p> I would pretend forgetting about it on the table. </p>
  <p> I already spent the night at Peter’s home, a  nice meal and a bath, this already a lot, how can I take this money. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  guess Peter knew I wouldn’t have accepted it, </p>
  <p>so he wrote on the envelope only  open after arriving in Paris, so even if I want to give it back, </p>
  <p>there is no  way I could.  </p>
  <p>Holding this money, I went  to eat a nice meal with salad, BBQ meat, fries and bread in a sidewalk café.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190385.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>After  eating so many days of toast, now eating this full meal, my mouth chewing, then  my tears started falling down. </p>
  <p> The boss  said is the hot sauce too hot?  The whole  atmosphere is not the same now. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  this trip, I owe lots to the countries I passed by, and the people who are on  this land too much.  </p>
  <p>I can’t give back all,  every time changing to a new country; I use the local dialect to say  thanks.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  want to thank those countries, they give me food when I am hungry, letting me a  place to sleep in cold nights, </p>
  <p>and a warm hands helping me when I need it.  I am not the best, the people I meet on this  trip are. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  didn’t finish this trip on my own; I really did finish 14000+km on this trip,  on a bicycle.  </p>
  <p>The bike didn’t require  any gas, but it required lots of pumps for the tire.  Lots of inner tubes and tires were broken on  this trip.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  this trip I don’t feel lonely because there is a partner with me, sharing every  moment with me.  </p>
  <p>In the cold night when I  am inside the tent, looking at the bike, I sadly say today you will have to  experience the coldness again. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  it rains, tire blew, or when I break something, I will apologize to the bike  saying I am sorry for putting you in this position.  </p>
  <p>When fixing the bike, I would sing and say,  don’t worry, when I finish fixing you, we will continue to ride the rest of the  trip. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lots  of people told me to toss away the broken tires, riding with broken tire, other  than being very heavy, what is the point?   </p>
  <p>Of course they have meaning, they are part of the bike, how can I toss  them on the side of the road.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Dido, is not like a boat where it talks; it endures the bad road and weather  condition silently.  </p>
  <p>I am lucky, I can  sit on you and ride all the way from Beijing to Paris.</p>
  <p><img src="photo/P1190350.jpg" width="900" height="506" /></p>
  <p>Dido,  if you can say something, what would you want to say?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Looking  at you from sitting on the ground, I just starred at you. </p>
  <p> Lots of people say I can ride so far, but I  am not a hero, because I am not the one that is tired, anyone can ride  this.  </p>
  <p>So any compliments toward me you  should proudly receive them, because you are excellent.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So  for people who do not know who I am, no need to remember who I am either. </p>
  <p>Just remember, in 2007, a bicycle crossed  Asia to Europe, finished a trip a car took  over 100 years ago. </p>
  <p> What is the point  for this trip?  I don’t want to argue, I  just want to let everyone know there are too many cars,</p>
  <p> and the exhaust gas from  the car is about to destroy the earth.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A 100 years after now when you and I are  not here, what will we leave behind?  </p>
  <p>I  hope in future time, there will be people still hearing about this trip, and  hearing people’s laugh from riding bicycles.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The End </p>
